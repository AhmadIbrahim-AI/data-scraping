"“A thriller set in the world of drug trafficking evokes the high stakes and high risks of the drug trade”--a synopsis of the new movie “Sicario”? Actually this is the first line of the 2000 movie “Traffic” but describes both movies. I had heard good word of mouth about “Sicario” and with 7 new movies opening today I put a question as which one to see on the film buffs facebook page and the vote was overwhelmingly for this movie. All I have to ask is, “why?” Yes, Benicio Del Toro gives a mesmerizing performance, as a former Columbian who was a prosecutor and has good reason to hate drug dealers. It is explained that sicario is slang for a hitman and he defines the term. One of the many things I didn’t like about the movie is that you will know the reason why before it is spelled out. Josh Brolin, a favorite of mine, as head of a task force but for who unknown, gives a solid performance. I have heard much about Emily Blunt’s performance but I found her to be way out of her depth as an equal FBI agent in the playing field of macho acting men. Anyone who has even seen a movie about drug cartels know it is a rough, tough no holds barred, world of killing and “Sicario” shows that from the opening with a house invasion exposing dozens of rotting bodies in plastic, followed by naked bodies hanging upside down in the Mexican streets. Shortly after there is a scene of the ‘good’ guys slaughtering 8-10 guys in a traffic tie-up at the border.  Later there is torturing with water, beatings, forcibly poking of a finger in someone’s ear and, yes, the scene of a lone man shooting, killing 7 men. While the point of violence is necessary to show there are quite a few gratuitous scenes. There is a strong supporting cast from Jon Bernthal as a pickup in a bar to Bernardo Saracino as a major cartel boss and  Julio Cesar Cedillo as a minor one along with Daniel Kaluuya, as Blunt’s partner, who requires a suspension of belief to accept his character and Victor Garber as one of the many bosses of the American team along with others. While direction by Denis Villkeneuve is very professional neither he nor the screenwriter Taylor Sheridan bring anything new to the drug trafficking movie including that it is violent and bad guys on both sides of the fence. The opening music was, to me, a blasting wall of sound and at times during the film very intrusive while at times thye camera work of Roger Deakins was really first rate. Now I need to know what the film buffs who recommended the film saw in “Sicario” that I didn’t.",2.0,1,0
" I found the endless obsession with dark-this and dark-that, to be a depressing one-note that hung around from beginning to end. The moral complications were contrived and pretentious. A number of liberties were taken with the logic of the action. What I found most odd is that 'the batman' seemed out of place in his own movie, as if some dude in a cape kept popping in and out of a more serious, real-world crime drama.",5.0,1,0
"The Messenger is the second best Iraqi war movie of 2009, it's not as good as The Hurt Locker but still proves it's self among other war movies by being better.  The best war movies I have seen that are worth to watch again and again are Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan and Platoon.. They were able to capture the essence and pathos of soldiers. There are many more that I would like to see. However there are not much Iraq war movies out there, until Kathryn Bigelow directed and release The Hurt Locker which won Best Picture and Best Director. Then came along another film that people ignore and it's worth a watch. The Messenger talks about grief, loneliness, pain and the transition to coexist in the real world. Our men in uniform call home the real world while the combat zone is hell. I personally experience my cousin who's like a brother to me went to Iraq and came back injured and the terrible time our family went through. He's all right now and finish with the Army. I love movies that deeply respect soldiers and doesn't succumb them into melodramatic plots and clich?ar stories or bloody violence. I'm talking to you Pearl Harbor and Windtalkers. Ben Foster who I compare to Anthony Mackie from The Hurt Locker who should have been nominated plays Staff Sgt. Will Montgomery. He just came back from Iraq after serious injuries. He's already despising the fact of everybody calling him a hero. He already has bad luck when his girlfriend leaves him for another guy. He has three months left on his enlistment and his commanding officer orders him to join the Army's Casualty Notification service. He's reluctant but is forced to join. Here he meets Capt. Tony Stone who is he's partner and training officer. The movie is power full when they go and notify the families of the fallen soldiers. There are gut wrenching scenes which are not to be taken lightly especially if you are family who has lost loved one in Iraq. There is a scene with the great actor Steve Buscemi that completely steals the scene and one of my favorite scenes of the movie.  Then they notify Kelly played very well by Jena Malone who is now a single mother because of her husband dying. Strangely Will is attracted and intrigue by her. He helps her with things around the house and visits her and eats dinner with her and her son. This is something that he can't do and angers Tony, Will who feels everybody in the world doesn't understand him Kelly is a safe haven for him. She's needy and he's needy in his own way. The movie works as well because of the chemistry Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster has. They start off not liking each other but gradually getting along. Tony feels the up most respect towards Will because of his combat experience and at the same time jealousy because of his lack of combat. Will teaches Tony that the families are human then just names on a piece of paper. I feel the flaw of the film is that it loses its focus when the romance starts with Will and Kelly. There are good scenes between them, don't get me wrong but I feel the movie loses track and doesn't head into the right direction but it does pick it self up and finish very satisfying. The movie is thought full and very respectful towards its subject. The movie has no war violence whatsoever but Will's brutal description of the events will make you shudder. A very good movie and must be seen. Note: It's funny on my senior year I was going to join the Army and I was to be sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky and my MOS was going to be Calvary Scout. I was ready to go April 23, 2005, my mom got hit by a car and I couldn't go. My pregnant wife and mom begged me not go back again. I think to myself if I would have still join where would be now? Could I be somewhere around the world, or would my wife get that two neatly dressed service men on the door? This movie made me think that way. My prayers go to all our woman and men in uniform.",9.0,0,1

" Despite terrific performances from Rourke and Tomei, Aronofsky can't keep from sinking them with mawkish sentimentality and clunky dialogue that gets worse and worse.

" This film started so strongly; I was mesmerized by the visuals, the Low soundtrack, the edginess--yet compassion it contained in those first 15 minutes. Then it soared downhill. A real shame--because this should have been a masterpiece judging from the promise of the opening. Instead, it becomes Caouette's song of himself--a music video walking on the wild side. All the fancy effects, groovy camerawork and nifty music can't make up for narrative that disappears. Characters appear and disappear so quickly, one has no chance of making a connection. Except Caouette himself--and his obvious need for validation. That, perhaps is the final impression of this film. It feels insincere exploitive in the end.",5.0,1,0

"Marty is a normal highschool student in Hill Valley. He likes a rock n rall and skateboard, and get a great friend, Doc Brown who convert 'DeLorean-car' to 'DeLorean-timemachine.' One day, terrorist assult Doc Brown and Marty bacause of plutonium. Doc get a gunshot, and Marty drive the DeLorean until 88mile per hour to rewind 30 years, for changing today. After Marty arrive the past, he tries to save Brown, but he doesn`t accept his suggestion. Doing that, Marty take a chance that meet his parents, but he get in the trouble related his life. Because he go back to the past, Brown save his life and black mayor get errected. It is 'today' to Marty but 'past' to Brown and other people. Therefore, I think Marty change only one thing, his family. In Marty`s past, they got unfair treatment, but, in Marty`s future, they become a high class. Watching this movie, I take a long time to think about time travel. I want to ask one question to you, If you go back to the past, can you change something in today? My answer is no, because all about today`s situations are caused by past things` conclutions. Your today is another`s past. However, in Back to the Future, Marty change his 1985s. In my opinion, it is just dramatic elements or the message that movie director want to send to audiences, ""humans are strong as can change the future."" (or not)",10.0,0,1
"There's so much true Star Wars fans have to be upset about with this movie. The most lacking factor was wow, wonderment and awe. Plus the fact that this film had no suspense and not one great action set piece. (a first for a Star Wars film and sad) TFA feels like Star Wars The TV Movie. And if it was a TV Movie on ABC, I would have been a little more impressed but this is the first Star Wars movie in theaters that is not an EPIC. I never felt transported to other worlds, I saw a desert and a forest with minimal production design. The Prequels are looking really good right now in that aspect (actually in every aspect). I give it two stars because of the actors and the ""funny moments"" but besides that it has no build up, at times its silly, and pandering. (I feel that John Williams had no idea how to score TFA because every action scene has no buildup thus no need for his amazing talent to give rise and build to scenes, not his fault) Rey has an unusual knowledge of the force, even though she has no real idea what it is. Things that took Luke 2 movie's to do, Rey did in 1 movie. I was reminded of this while watching The Empire Strikes Back when Luke is hanging upside down and is reaching for his Lightsaber, he is struggling to reach it and its very close by. Rey was able to do it with ease with no training from Yoda and from a much further distance. Its ugly women empowerment pandering ""Anything you can do, I can do better"" in a film series that is more about Father and Sons than anything else. They destroyed a bit of the gravity of the series with that nonsense throughout the film. And I am not a Women Empowerment hater, Mad Max: Fury Road and Jupiter Ascending proved that that sort of Propaganda if you will can be done right and us guys have to shut up because it was done with thoughtfulness and heart. TFA is not that, the whole film feels rushed especially the characters development. My final negative point is something I read in another review which summed up my worst fears of what this film could have been which is: ""Which brings me to what I hated the most about the movie, and the main reason I'm giving it such a low score: it erases anything good and fulfilling we had at the end of Return of the Jedi. Every single one of the original heroes failed miserably in every aspects of their lives. Where is the reward for being good, just and do heroic deeds?So... Han failed as a husband, as a father, as a member of the resistance and overall as a man (a bitter one it seems)... same goes for Leia (oh, she is a general of a sidekick cell that's supported by the republic... great). Luke is the worse of them all: failed as a jedi master, failed as a protector of the galaxy, as uncle, as friend, as brother, as the owner of R2D2"" TFA broods with so much negativity and abandons everything that our heroes fought so hard to protect. Its a huge slap in the face. It undermines the power of GOOD. Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker all deserve a grace period after what they've been though and this film denied us that forever. We are right back in the same loop, and I get it most people come from broken homes, or fatherless childs, (I'm one of them) etc. But that doesn't mean films have to pander to society in such a manner. It could have been a great example to show that the GOOD in the world has to be protected and that its a torch of hope that we pass down to our children. TFA in my opinion has destroyed much history and has set us up for a very negative Trilogy, I guess one about the loop of destruction. And maybe that would have been acceptable if the movie was great via amazing set pieces, visual spectacle, wonderment, better pacing, a memorable score, and inspired production design but it didn't even do that. All things that are Star Wars Traditions. There's more of course, Plot holes all over the place and the misuse of Captain Phasma, is she dead?",3.0,1,0

" Whoa! This movie wasn't what I was expecting. I purposefully don't read much of reviews because they always give away too much, but I'm a junky for 3D movies and I saw the high marks for this one so I couldn't wait. The thing was, I was expecting it to be a kids' movie, and it wasn't that at all. It was waaaay too creepy, edgy, scary, strange, and freaky for children, I felt. It bore a lot in common with Pan's Labrynth and The Orphanage, and was similar in tone to those. There was one spectacular scene visually in a garden at night, but mostly I just felt really creeped out and disturbed. In general, I usually disagree with the high marks that clay-mation films get, not because I don't like claymation, but because I usually find them to be too slow, or them to be a little too dark and strange, or their stories to just not be as strong as I would hope, and yet they always seem to get rave reviews from the critics regardless. This film seemed derivative of the two other movies I mentioned, and was very creepy and weird, so if you liked those films you might really enjoy this, but it's not really my thing, and definitely don't go in expecting a fun, light rompy kids movie, and do realize that if you take small children there will likely be uncomfortable moments, and quite possibly nightmares from it(I think I might have some nightmares from it, and I'm a grown man!).",6.0,0,1
" It is really a testament to the sadness of America that half of them cannot appreciate a film like this. Most of them just think it is dumb--they say it is ""disjointed"" or that the leads have ""no chemistry"". This is what doing nothing but watching TV and standard Hollywood films does to your brain: you can't understand real human relationships (which are not ""explainable"" and are in fact ""random"", at least for most of us), you can't empathize with those who clearly have some sort of disorder, and can't figure out the unity of an actually pretty straightforward film, by artistic cinematic standards. Then, perhaps even worse, there are a group who recognize that they can't understand the film, but are too proud to admit it and accuse the film of being ""pretentious"" and full of ""fake symbolism"". I am not surprised though, that those who were expecting a standard Adam Sandler film, where you are supposed to laugh at someone who is different, didn't like this film, where you are supposed to feel for someone who is different. A shame.",10.0,0,1

" Pride & prejudice had some lovely moments, beautiful scenery and some very good actors but keira knightley was so wrong for the part of elizabeth bennett!!!!! i was vastly dissapointed, as she is the main character. she was too smirky, forward, gangly and looked like a street urchin. her hair looked greasy and unwashed for most of the film which brought to my notice the fact it wasn't even her hair but a wig. and would lizzie ever have worn a piece of rag in her hair? -- especially when her sisters were dressed prettily in soft coloured gowns and ringleted hairstyles!!were they trying to make lizzie a tomboy rebel? i did like d'arcy. i thought he was handsome and did a good job showing the change from d'arcy's cold/proud/shy demeanor to the turmoil that we find in him as he exposes his love for miss bennett. oh, i went in with such expectations...but for God's sake does keira knightley have to take every major englishwoman's role even if she is completely not the actress for the part just because her name might herd in the viewers?!!!",5.0,1,0
"Pixar is on a strike, would be understanding things they have never seen a fall remains the truth.A Bug's LifePixar is covering another part of the world as an excuse of educating and entertaining the children whose pseudo effect is serving a compelling drama for adults. Or at least that's what it feels like. And this is their genius. Replacing the throne of Disney in this current generation, Pixar is actually has smart filmmakers and storytellers in its pocket. And carrying out the similar formulas used back in the old days in the name of fairy tales, the banner has pressed plenty of adorable animal friendly anecdotes to woo the younger audience in. And with baffling premises and witty strategies, they have stayed toe to toe with the social and filmmaking changes.As in they have matured wisely for the hip and happening culture that they have wished to be a part of. Checking off another territory, this time the writer and director John Lasseter is focusing on a smaller and hard working kingdom. Ergo emerges his lead character, contradicting the nature and the world he revolves around, his laziness is smart and curiosity efficiently effective.But as most of the game changers goes through, he is bogged down by the slow minded wrong doers and fear lovers and is cornered to go through a journey of rethinking and evaluation. But this is why I love these Pixar movies the most, even at its peak of necessary dramatic elements, they tend to carve a big piece of levity in the narration that is always attention grabbing and easily nuanced. But this goes unnoticed, usually because they are not afraid of using new almost-guest-alike characters introduced and surfed every now and then for a quality situational comedy and not just one liners. In A Bug's Life the most fascinating and thrilling scenario is their version of a city life, such metaphors come easy and a lot in this wonderful inspirational tale.",6.0,0,1
"I'm simply shocked over critics, which give this film less than an 80 rating, basing it on the story! How stupid can you be? Has the 'theme' been done before?? Yes, but so what? The story in Titanic was done before too. The matrix to me was a better version of 'Dark City', and how many films have there been about Queen Elizabeth? To me, this is a familiar theme done in a different way ' and for that ' it deserves my 100 points. Most stories today can be traced back to a familiar fairytale ' but that shouldn't take away from the film as a standalone project. It's magnificent and it's one of the few films in a long time worth my $12.",10.0,0,1
"Overall, Denzel Washington gives a good performance for a character that is not in the one bit likable. As character stories go, Whip never learns from his mistakes, but that's kind of the point of the character development. Because his addiction is so deep, his life revolves around alcohol and it's been his only escape from all his failures as a husband and father, and his failures as a noble and good person. The movie is ok, but spends too much time playing around with the idea of the plane crash and everything that happens as ""an act of God,"" when in reality everything happens for a reason. But the whole time, Whip never learns. I guess that's the point of the movie. In that case, the message is flawed and difficult to really enjoy.",5.0,1,0

" A fantastic film. It feels like a vintage Akira Kurosawa film, with a slightly slow pace which takes time to allow its characters to reflect, while also not neglecting sporadic, chaotic action scenes throughout the film. To those that say it is revisionist, I disagree. The film does an admirable job of showing the militaristic fascism of the japanese while also not demonizing them. There were only a few hundred japanese left alive out of 22,000. Franklly, I do not believe that THAT many of them were suicidal fanatics. Instead I do believe that many Americans killed prisoners out of fear, anger or whatever. It does not make America bad, only those soldiers. Those soldiers are the same in any war, which is Eastwood's entire point. There are slight tweaks to history, for example, where the officer brings his horse to the island, it was actually left in Japan, but in my opinion that enhances the story. A great film.",10.0,0,1

"It has some very sporadic chuckles in its first half, flashes of wit, and striking performances especially from the two leads. But other than that, It's neither funny nor original. I have seen quite few films with this theme, or that are classified under this sub-genre (I haven't even seen Superbad), but I already found everything here quite familiar. The plot itself is clichéd, insipid, formulaic, and oversimplified. And you can clearly notice that at every single turning point in the story. And there are a lot in the second half, for it's very overstuffed, messy, and muddled. And that, of course, caused a lot of tonal imbalances.I'm really frustrated because I thought I would see something like Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig's fantastic and highly auspicious directorial debut. But Booksmart seems to think it is much smarter then it actually is. I have to give Olivia Wilde points for making such an energetic and colorful film, though.

"There are some films that reach technical perfection and are visually magnificent, but simply have no script to stand themselves. This film is one of them.It is extraordinary how Peter Jackson made a three-hour movie with so little story to tell! Full of visual effects and green screen, the film bases its script on three characters: Ann Darrow, an actress who is failing to succeed, Jack Driscoll, a potential playwright forced to write a film script and finally Carl Denham, a filmmaker candidate willing to do anything for success. With his immense ambition, Denham leads the action to a mysterious unknown island populated by terrible creatures. We don't know the extent of his knowledge of the island, but he will do anything to get there and film. This happens, sensibly, in the first 45 minutes, that is, what we have in this film is two and a half hours watching characters running or fighting for their lives. There is no plot.Concerning the cast, there are also some flaws, despite the quality and weight of the actors. Naomi Watts was fine, given the circumstances, but it is far below what I expected, considering she was already an excellent actress when she made this film. Jack Black was very well. He is not an actor that I like, but he was able to give his character some cleverness laden with malice. I just didn't like that, at the end, he was able to get away with so much impunity. Adrien Brody is good and does what he is asked to do with some talent, but his character is very flat, one-dimensional, even underdeveloped. Andy Serkis was very important in turning King Kong into a realistic creature, but I don't consider his work here to be a true dramatic interpretation.Visually great, it uses and abuses CGI, visual and special effects, and colorful and lively cinematography helps to give the film an extraordinary beauty and realism. The sound is also amazing, with all the effects harmonizing well, even during the most confusing action scenes. And action is not lacking in this film, as I already mentioned. The film really deserved the three Oscars it received in the categories of Best Visual Effects, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing. The soundtrack could have been better but there is no denying that, in general, the film is technically excellent, justifies the budget well and is at the level of the best blockbuster.",5.0,1,0

For me the concept would have worked much better if it followed an actual family, and recorded their moments rather than being a series of set pieces played by actors, some of which you can relate to in your own life and those of your children and your parents. Its a great concept and an interesting film, but I thought it didn't really live up to the wide acclaim the film has been given.",7.0,0,1
"I have mixed feelings toward this movie. Looper was well edited, and suspenseful. The acting was solid, and I enjoyed the futuristic/dystopian world they created. The music fit the mood perfectly, the cinematography was also great. The problems start with the movie's plot. There are some plot holes and inconsistencies in the story, because the way time traveling was portrayed. It was impossible even on a theoretical level. I wish they didn't ruin up the time travel, because that part was meant to be a key element, but it just made the plot confusing and senseless at some points.

"Natalie Portman was difficult to watch in this so-called psychological thriller.

"85/100Hmm ... I don't watch romantic movies, but I liked this one.Let's start with the biggest white ball: music and cinematography. I never realized how beautiful the black and white films are. I do not know if this movie was shot more nicely than Roma ... I think I like more Cold War. Helps (in my opinion) the aspect ratio of 4:3. The songs are great. I think I'm going to listen to the soundtrack again.Another white ball is acting. Am I the only one that thinks Joanna Kulig looks like Jennifer Lawrence?And now comes the bad part ... I did not really care about the characters, I do not know why. There are some moments when I should feel sad but ... I could not. I think I would have given it a 95/100 if I had been interested ...

"First off, congratulations, Star Wars, on reaching adulthood. From the opening shots, one cannot miss that the franchise is under the Iron fist in a three fingered glove management of Disney, not LucasFilm; there is no doubt that it will be handled with the same careful nurturing that managed to husband the tiny shoots of diverse 19th century fairytales into unstoppable GMOs of worldwide marketing. Abrams successfully puts Star Wars back on the main line to tons of future stories. By the end of the movie we introduced a new generation of bold characters (Finn and Rey) and dispatched old storylines with prejudice. We have no more Jar Jar; no more Yoda, no more Obiwan, no more Qui-Jon. In fact, and more on this later, aside from the main opposition characters, no master figures at all who aren’t related to the bloodline.As one might expect, SW:TFA does have a real identity crisis. Is it a reboot, a sequel or a retirement tour? It’s asked to serve all three masters so ends up a bit of each, which makes it feel torn in different directions. It does give a very loving sendoff to all the old characters. And, I mean all of them. They managed to tip the cap to every race and minor character that the writers thought the audience could even vaguely stand* (who knew that the Cantina band had gone Reggae?) even if they had to herd them into one shot together so they could all take a bow without chewing up any storyline (I’m looking at you, former Admiral, now 5th spearcarrier from the left, Akbar). Come on, R2D2 was literally rusting in the corner and got woken up for one scene just to bleep goodbye.Others have observed as well, and I agree, with the innumerable look and feel ‘tributes’ this film gives to the original - lines, shots, visuals, music cues, sound effects, in every scene. I had to overcome the feeling that SW:TFA writers were rummaging around in my emotional pockets trying to scrape together enough loose change to buy them a genuine nostalgia for the original SW, back before the dark times, before the prequels. But, I suppose thankfully, it became so routine by the middle of the movie that I became numb to it.Abrams also wastes no time in advancing the story, delving not a jot into the interior life of the characters, except in the most cursory way with Kylo Ren, which is both good and bad. Star Wars is at its best a good rollicking adventure - short on planning ahead, long on diving in.However, I am not alone, I hope, in noticing that the only sources of conflict in the latest two Star Wars movies are child figures who are possessed by the dark side of the force in what seems to amount not to the telling of a grand monomyth of oedipal conflict but rather to their teenage snits over how their parents didn’t like them. I commented on this in re Episode III, but Kylo Ren in SW:TFA seems to suffer from it also. Doesn’t the galaxy have any pressing problems other than parents who are a pain in the ass?**As an aside, since this looks like the last hurrah for all the old actors, will the character of ex-princess Leia of Alderaan disappear before her legacy is explained? As we follow all the plot, the other Skywalkers leave a legacy, either good or bad, in the next generation. What about Leia? For instance, between Mr and Mrs Solo, who is more likely to have turned young Kylo on to the Dark Side? Han, who despite his protestations, as played by Harrison Ford, doesn’t have a mean bone in his body and runs rather than fighting, or Leia, who as played by Carrie Fisher, practically claws everyone’s face off in every scene where she appears. Leia actually has some motivation for Dark Side revenge too. She actually had a planet shot out from under her adopted family (well, even her whole adopted culture) by the Empire, now under new management as the First Order. Speaking of misses, it is notable when Poe Dameron who seemed to have some promise as the swashbuckling replacement for Han Solo disappears off screen, only to turn up half the movie later without more than a brief explanation. Shades of Biggs and Wedge, I guess X-wing pilots don’t deserve screen time except when attacking large round death stars, uh, death planets.Overall, not too bad. And, yes, JJ Abrams is much better suited to do Star Wars bang-bang than ponderous Star Trek man-man-vulcan love. Sure, lots of rehash of the old, but we expected that. On the up side, this movie opens the door for some good stories if the writers can take advantage, especially to create new situations and characters in the Star Wars universe. The open question is still, by time this series has gone the full nine innings, and credit to my wife for this quote: “Will it be anything more than ‘At Home with the Skywalkers’”?[*] Sorry, Jar Jar, or is that Darth Jar Jar?[**] Perhaps it is the writers’ opinion that the Skywalker men are simply whiny **** but I suppose teen angst will fit right in with the Disney model.",6.0,0,1
"When a tragic 2015 fire in Bucharest's Colectiv nightclub killed 64 and injured 143, with 37 of the victims dying after the fact, primarily from hospital infections, the event launched a sweeping investigation into the Romanian health care system. This revelation, which was brought to light by a team of reporters from a daily sports journal of all things, led to the dissolution of the government and a probing look into the nation's hospital network, exposing system-wide corruption that had been in place long before the catalytic event that spurred this inquiry. ""Collective"" relates the unfolding of these events through unprecedented access to the journalists and reformers who sought to expose a system where patient care was secondary to the self-serving interests of politically connected administrators and their crooked affiliates. However, while director Alexander Nanau's impressive and authentic documentary is indeed a remarkable piece of investigative journalism, its raw footage approach to the presentation of its material is often dry and talky, failing to stoke the kind of outraged emotional response that a work like this should handily accomplish. It thus plays more like a radio report on film than an engaging cinematic presentation, diluting much of the impact that its findings should generate. Sadly, the victims of this tragedy truly deserve more, not only from the government that let them down, but also from the vehicle through which their story was told.",6.0,0,1

"Yep, another masterpiece, only... not so much. If movies are primarily about the story, the new Blade Runner sucks. There are too many unnecessary scenes, too many amazingly slow ones, and many which I like to call executions - on the surface something happens there, but indeed they are only about exposition. Every scene with annoying Jared Leto is just that: cheap exposition. Bad guys are one-dimensional, unlike Rutger Hauer in the first movie.  Rich, original environment of the first movie are now desolate ruins. Which is nice, for a second, but then you see almost all scenes are empty.

"Paul Dano was 16 when he started his career as a film actor. This is his first directorial effort, which interestingly revolves around a 14 year old boy.

"The Force Awakens had a huge amount of potential that could have been used to reinvigorate the franchise to a point where it would have become an international religion. So many things were done right; yet, so many things were done wrong that the movie suffered as a whole. Let's start with what they did right.Introducing new characters. They needed to introduce characters such as Rey and Finn into the film in order to foster a new generation of pure badassery.  Daisy Ridley was brilliant in her role. Rey really did come to life for me, and was in my opinion, more believable of a character than any other in the film. The introduction of oldies, but goodies, was well-paced and generally thoughtful. They did honestly try hard to pay homage to the past while bringing the future into the forefront. The story was generally well-put together, and the action scenes were pretty brilliant. A testament to J.J.'s particularly grandiose skills. However, that is where the good parts end. The acting in the film is better than in some of the more recent films of the franchise, but most of the characters suffer from a lack of depth of feeling. In Episodes 4, 5, and 6, Darth Vader is brilliantly imposing. The people around him genuinely fear being under his command. His silence is ominous, his anger pure and antiseptic. His rage was terrifying, because his strength was undeniable from the first moments in A New Hope. We loved him because he was an archetypal terror! The villains in The Force Awakens, well, lets just say they leave much to be desired... Rips from the plot of A New Hope, the Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are abound throughout the film. Iconic moments are taken and recycled into this movie without pause or concern for the well-being of the plot in an effort to entertain old die-hards who can't understand that change is inevitable. This blatantly formulaic approach to the film just gave us more of the same. When Disney trashed the extended universe to make way for new canon material, the fans expected more. We expected new, powerful, masterful material instead of the plot re-write from long long ago. Instead, we got a recycled film without real creativity from the ground up. Overall, the film suffers from having too many things to introduce and too many story arcs that have very little to do with one another. And because of that broadness, the story lacks in depth, and the length of the film cannot do justice to what they tried to accomplish. Many things seem to be in the film as an afterthought for decisions that were made. You will like it. It is fun and exciting! Though we have one quote for the producers of the next few films: “...But beware of the dark side... If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice...” - Yoda",4.0,1,0
"It is good closure for this saga of 22 films a great homage to Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. that started this whole thing up, a well managed to a certain point plot about time travel that has its plot holes without which you couldn't justify more than one event in the movie, the most commonly complained aspects I've watched are Professor Hulk, fat Thor and the scene of just superheroines, and they're not bad those have a justification among some other things like several deus ex machinas, the third act is super epic and it's fan service well done not like Batman V Superman where is poorly executed but it is not enough for me to be a better movie in general than Infinity War. More than the plot holes or the ridiculousness of the jokes what I disliked the most was how impertinent they were with the product placement, a commercial for Fortnite, a commercial for Axe and the most brazen of all the Audi one, its clear they gave more priority to other things that make it a coherent film with cinematographic arguments.",8.0,0,1

The form of the story is excellent, but the story itself is painfully old fashioned and the obsessive focus on the lovers was truly tiring. Why was further attention not paid to the wives? The children? The community? The supposed murderers? Surely their characters are just as interesting as the two dimensional (though beautiful) Ennis and Jack.

" Coppola's playfulness is given full reign in several imaginatively retro montage sequences. Newspaper headlines pass over shots of hands passing the spaghetti bowl at one of those impromptu feasts that nourished the underworld. Equally potent is the quick cutting between images of Michael, at the baptism of a godchild, promising a priest that he will renounce Satan at the same time that his enemies are being gorily gunned down all over town. Coppola knew how to create monsters - Michael and his father - and make us gleefully root for their triumph. Michael, especially monstrous because with his education and early vow to stay clear of the family business, his slow evolution into cold-blooded killer seems more unforgivable. The collaboration between director and actor here is magical. We actually see Michael's face go deader as the movie progresses, and his eyes seem to narrow as if Michael can no longer bear what he sees around him and himself.

" 'Up in the Air' is one of those multi-layered films that define good direction, great scriptwriting, and superb acting.

Here was an adult with the mind of a teen who could not see beyond surface plot lines and did not understand that the film was about a wasted life, and did not have a clue that the title 'Up in the Air' had a double meaning as well. The only fault I had with this film was after you realize what the film was really about after about 30 minutes, the coming resolutions were obvious.

"The action of this film takes place in Dublin, Ireland, and shows the story of a young man, willing to be a musician, who plays in the streets. There, he meets a beautiful immigrant girl who is also attracted to the world of music. Both are young, and the romantic attraction between them gradually becomes more obvious, despite the fact that she has a husband in her country (the Czech Republic) and he has a girlfriend who recently moved to London without him.It is a relatively simple story, where two young people cultivate common interests and a friendship that may, or may not, lead to something more. For me, and although the film manages to avoid cheap sentimentality and empty and worn out romantic clichés, it is a very scarce script for a feature film, and on several occasions I felt that the film did not have a story to tell, just a succession of melodies and songs that were appearing one after the other, and that I felt were there to fill space and time. The film is very sweet, romantic and light, but it is not incredible, and I feel that it was also overestimated by the critics, especially since it was nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Song (which, by the way, it came to collect).The cast's work is heavily penalized by the absence of material to work with and by a set of characters that were only slightly outlined and underdeveloped. The two co-protagonists, Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová, nevertheless, did a job that can be considered decent: they look quite natural and their chemistry is good, although neutral and drowned out by their gifts as singers.Technically, the film has ups and downs, but the very low production budget does not allow for great flights. The sound and the soundtrack clearly stand out, with some very high quality songs (the highlight goes, of course, to the song ""Falling Slowly"") and others that seem somewhat improvised.

There were no scares for me and just seemed like a drag on.

The plot is lost in this movie, as hollywood continues to think that we are looking to them for political opinions.

"I run a film review blog over at Baltic Avenue Productions called Walkin' Talkin' Pictures. I'd encourage you to go there to check out the full review but here's an excerpt: Sorry to Bother You is a pretty mixed bag. My gut impression is it will get better with age. It is written in a very reactionary moment in American history and it captures truths of that moment that we are too close to see or understand. My guess is it will improve with multiple viewings. The plot is so bombastic and scattered it’s hard to walk out with the message while you’re trying to track the story. The biggest hesitation to I have to recommend this film is it’s challenging. It’s not fun to watch. You spend most of it feeling uncomfortable and you walk out feeling dirty. Ideologically I think Sorry to Bother You is some harsh, harsh medicine America needs to take, but Riley’s message might have gotten in the way of sexing it up enough so we could take it.",6.0,0,1

Oh... and most of all, I didn't feel like I was watching a ""Star Wars"" movie. Good old characters, good old music, good old light sabers... but it was closer to another typical Hollywood SF movie.

"There is a lot to explore in O'Brain's novel, but Weir's procedure is probably not the way to command this ship.Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The WorldWeir has an apologetic letter to post. His somber world turns shade a bit darker every time this troop tries to celebrate small wins. Hanging by the cliff, these character and the director, Peter Weir is surviving this trip on low fuel. But, first of all, I think I should apologize before he does. ""It is not him, it is me"". The pirate-isc world was never my forte. Even in The Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Johnny Depp had to invent one of the most iconic character to lure me in. I am usually under the ""tough audience"" section in these shows.And since there is no Johnny Depp (although, half way through I genuinely was hoping for him to appear and just.. escape) or mythology involved in this drama- more than adventure, for sure- there is very little in their kit to entertain me. Nevertheless, there is a lot to devour in here. Of course, the brotherly romance between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany is the top contender, where I'd be honest, I didn't see it coming how deep and honest this equation would go; them sharing few tunes alone in a room- not a euphemism- is possible the only calm and stable scene that clears your mind.Another textbook issue that emerges is for our hero Crowe to realize and respect the value of the post he is on, and with few mistakes and losses and wins, he finally gets there, although I'd say he was about an hour late. The production design is stunning along with the cinematography, Miramax is definitely showing off and why not, the Oscars season is coming up, they'd definitely need some higher authority to swoop in couple of those golden tickets, and this time they chose, Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World.",5.0,1,0

"Linklater is scoring something so big here, that not only us, but the stars themselves find reminiscing about the good days.Dazed And ConfusedLinklater is clear and alert about his project. Featuring a train of various sketchy sequence emerged from the carefree attitudes of the teenagers living the last day of the school like their last day of their lives, the director, Richard Linklater, has actually crafted a sensible meaningful party oozing the innocence behind the not-so-innocent deeds of these characters. In fact, there is a separate scene where the humiliation is turned to 11, deliberately. The senior girls chafing the junior ones religiously with bizarre new ways and then comforting them, after it all ends and welcoming them with open arms in their groups.Now, this is where Linklater sees his window to get in our mind, and he doesn't let go of that opportunity. Another trail of crumbs he spreads out, is the escapism theory that junior kids follow after being terrorized and threatened by the seniors, which turns itself into a whole new character. Matthew McConaughey coming up with the iconic line, ""Alright! Alright! Alright!"" is the least exciting bit, he performs in here.With a sensational easiness in his body language and language, he pitches every line as a punch line and as a result, you find yourself on the floor laughing and wishing for more of his non-informative and assertive dialogues. Similarly, carries Ben Affleck, a one dimensional character, a stereotypical bully that hits at every red sign as a sign of challenge. In fact, I love that scene when the aftermath of a fight-gone-wrong is showcased as a celebratory win.

"Nicole Holofcener writes and directs Please Give, a tart, touching indie drama about generosity and selfishness. Holofcener (Lovely & Amazing, Friends With Money) explores familiar territory in her latest film, showing the comedy and pathos of haves and have nots in Manhattan. Women's breasts are readied for scanning by mammogram technician Rebecca (Rebecca Hall) in the striking opening scene. Pale, serious Rebecca comforts and assists an unending parade of patients. A compulsive giver, she's not receiving much. Rebecca lives with her elderly grandmother and rarely goes out, not even to see the fall foliage upstate. To her, breasts are neither beautiful nor repulsive, but ""tubes that can get infected."" Holofcener shows the interplay between two Manhattan families, reflecting America's uneasy balance of wealth and poverty. Kate (Catherine Keener) and Alex (Oliver Platt) are a wealthy couple that resell contemporary antiques in their city showroom. The two live and work together all day long, an arrangement bound to strain any marriage. Adding to that tension is Kate as she plunks $20 bills into the hand of any homeless person she meets. Opportunities to profit and feel guilty about it abound as Kate and Alex acquire estate furniture bargains from grieving adults. Meanwhile their 15-year-old daughter Abby (refreshing Sarah Steele) begs for a pair of $200 designer jeans. Living next door is 91-year-old Andra (Ann Guilbert, who played nosy neighbor Millie Helper on the Dick Van Dyke Show). In space-hungry Manhattan, Kate and Alex have already purchased Andra's apartment and plan to expand their living space after she dies.

The biggest problem is the love story. Employing a Terrence Malick-esque esoteric voiceover, Jenkins lifts entire passages directly from Baldwin. However, what reads beautifully in the novel is badly out of place in the film, even in voiceover, and has the effect of rendering the two central characters unrealistic, with their love for one another idealised to such an extent as to become ridiculous.New York, 1974; 19-year old Clementine ""Tish"" Rivers (KiKi Layne) and 22-year old Alonzo ""Fonny"" Hunt (Stephan James) are in love, and planning to get married. However, when Fonny is accused of rape, the victim mistakenly identifies him in a line-up, and he is charged and detained. Awaiting his trial, Tish visits him in jail, telling him she is pregnant, and promising she'll do whatever it takes to get him out before the birth. With this as the central framework, the story is told in a non-linear style, jumping back and forth from one time period to another.This non-linear structure has an important thematic effect; we know from the second scene that Fonny is in jail, meaning that as we watch Tish and Fonny planning their future, there's a shadow over everything. For the most part, this contributes to the tone of the film. However, Jenkins overuses the technique. I understand why the film is told out of sequence, but not to the extent it is. Compare this with Sean Penn's The Pledge (2001), a linear narrative where he accomplishes the same thing with one out-of-sequence scene at the start of the film. Beale Street, on the other hand, jumps all over the place, never settling into a rhythm, with the cumulative effect one of distraction rather than immersion.Aesthetically, much like Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk looks amazing. From James Laxton's vibrant cinematography to Caroline Eselin's colour coordinated costume design, everything we see rings true, and much like Moonlight, the influence of Kar-Wai Wong is paramount; seen in the non-linear narrative and relatively slight plot, the poetic tone, the centrality of music, and the tendency to use visuals rather than dialogue to convey thematic points.As in both Medicine for Melancholy (2008) and Moonlight, Jenkins occasionally has characters speak directly to camera. They're not breaking the fourth wall, however. Such scenes are dialogue scenes, with the camera between the characters. It's a technique that was used most famously in The Silence of the Lambs, where each character looked into camera when speaking to Clarisse, whereas she always looked just slightly off-camera, setting up a fascinating visual contrast which encourages us to identify with her. Beale Street doesn't do anything as interesting or subtle with the technique, but Jenkins's tendency to use it during moments of heightened emotion does suture us into the milieu of the film.However, a serious problem at the film's core is the love story, wherein Fonny and Tish just don't seem like real people, not in the way they gaze into one another's eyes as if they are seeing each other for the first time, not in the way they speak to one another as if every syllable is of earth-shattering portentousness. They rarely speak normally; instead, they adopt the eloquence of James Baldwin. In lifting sections directly from the novel, Jenkins forgets that what works on the page, doesn't necessarily work on the screen, and the reproduction of Baldwin's rich and lugubrious prose is simply unrealistic, with the delivery sounding stilted and awkward, and, most egregiously, far beyond the lexicon of the characters.Another problem concerns the depiction of Bell (Ed Skrein), the racist cop who frames Fonny. Played as a leering pantomime villain, with bad hair, bad teeth, and bad skin, he's obviously a metaphor for the ugliness of racism, but he's so completely over the top, it rips you right out of the film. On the other hand, Regina King's portrayal of Tish's mother, Sharon, is exceptional.Beale Street is an undeniably beautiful film that depicts the love between two astonishingly attractive people (it's worth noting that in the novel, Fonny's unattractiveness is emphasised). However, Jenkins's interpretation turns Fonny and Tish into a Ken and Barbie-esque couple. Taking a meditative approach to the material, Jenkins's adaptation never rings true. Whereas Baldwin's Tish and Fonny are flawed, contradictory, and relatable, Jenkins's protagonists are too-perfect-to-be-real, with every agonisingly serious pronouncement they make to one another pushing them further and further away from connecting with the audience on an emotional level.",6.0,0,1
"Incredible cast, great idea on paper but executed very poorly. Coming off of the well deserved success of ""Get Out,"" Jordan Peele delivered us another potential smash hit with ""Us."" I really enjoy Peele's work, I like what he's doing with movies and I think ""Get Out"" really opened a lot of people's eyes with just how good Peele can be. ""US"" unfortunately represents a bit of a sophomore slump for Peele, which is unfortunate because this cast was fantastic. The film also had a good soundtrack, comedy that hit really well and did provide some intense moments of fear but unfortunately, the plot here is absolutely riddled with holes, especially towards the end that almost completely undoes everything this film does well. You can drive a truck through some of these plot holes, a lot of the things regarding the Tethered people make absolutely no sense and it drags this movie almost to a disappointing halt.",5.0,1,0
"Yes, the acting was great and deserving of an oscar, the story was not. This was a fine movie if you are not looking for any real climax and enjoy a very slow pace, this film is an  intricate look at an individual's struggle with public speaking.  There are no real highs or lows, nothing that is particularly dramatic and therefore was relatively flat, the acting was excellent and there was just enough of a script to keep you watching without losing interest. If going to movies is about entertainment and walking out ot the theater feeling like you had seen a memorable film this is not one of those. I could never see myself watching this movie again, this does not mean that it was bad, just that it was your typical  ""Picture of the Year"".",7.0,0,1
"A surprising last entry in the 'Cornetto Trilogy' but it's not the type of surprise that's entirely positive... Let me start off by saying that I was, and still am, a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead, and an even bigger fan of Hot Fuzz, so when I heard about a third Edgar Wright film starring the classic Pegg and Frost combination where the plot focused on a good ol' fashioned English piss up that then turned into an Alien invasion bash-up, I shat myself in anticipation. As you can tell by my 6/10 score though, I probably wasted a good pair of pants doing so. The first act does well to hype you up for the rest of the film. Pegg as an insane '90s replica with legs is humorous to behold but it seems as though it was the actor's weakest role in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong, Gary King is well written and pretty unique, but I'm not sure, I just feel as though it's a familiar actor playing an unfamiliar character. Frost is good as a character that's basically the reverse of King, but the rest of the main cast are almost identical to him in premise and that can come off as a bit unoriginal at times. Nevertheless, the first half of the film is great in a satirical, traditional English setting with hilarious dialogue as expected. My hype for seeing Pegg and Frost pissed up was almsot entirely satisfied... Then it gets to the Aliens... I know it's not very important, but the Aliens in this film are boring beyond belief. They're basically cyborgs with a robotic behavior replacing any sort of personality. Again, it's not a huge problem because the focus is supposed to be on Pegg and the gang, but it can be a bit distracting during dialogue and heated action sequences. It's just... we've seen this kind of stuff before so it seems uninspired and makes me lose a little too much interest in the story as a whole. Without giving anything away, the end of the film is pretty unusual and surprising, not your typical happy ending in the slightest. I won't ruin it, but just don't expect everything to work out just fine like I did. While we're on the subject of the end though, the 'network' A.I thing voiced by Bill Nighy is also incredibly unoriginal and dull, although again there is a few laughs to be had with his dialogue. Yet again, I know it's not supposed to be the focus, but this to me was a bit of a wasted potential for what could have been some fresh and original Aliens, and maybe like, they would come to Earth seeking Beer or something? Wouldn't THAT have been pretty interesting? But I digress... The action is pretty good and at least half of the movie's dialogue generates some chuckles, but I had high hopes for the finale in a trilogy I could have adored, and they just weren't met. It's an A-Grade Popcorn Movie, but other than that there isn't all that much else here. I'd definitely recommend Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead before I would even mention this one, so go see those if you haven't.",6.0,0,1
"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is a great film for newcomers to the series, but an overly familiar one for returning fans. Consistent action made for an entertaining experience from start to finish. With epic moments such as planet destruction, family betrayal, and Jedi genocide, there wasn't a dull moment. However, the film could almost be considered a remake of episode IV. The plot, the characters, and even individual scenes were so similar to the original film that the whole film felt like deja vu. There was Deathstar V2.0, R2D2 V2.0, Luke Skywalker V2.0, and even hopeless robot stroll through the desert 2.0. The new characters were decent with a variety of personalities and backstories. However, the only truely fresh character was Finn. Everyone else simply felt like past personas resurrected with a subtle twist. In the end, the movie was great fun, but nothing struck me as truly exceptional aside from the visuals and special effects.",8.0,0,1

" the best part of this movie is its soundtrack--and it's not even a musical. the score is the only element with range (ooooh and every transition is seamless!), while the characters are underdeveloped and (...wait for it...wait for it...) flavorless--ha!, and the colors are as dazzling as the arc de triomphe in fog. hell, even janeane garofalo manages total insipidity! her covert vocals are wondrous to be sure, but only magnify that Colette (a fair-weather feminist) does nothing to jazz up her wet noodle, Linguini (yukyuk), who in turn gives the evil Ego less than zilch to bounce off of. now, please don't think me hard-hearted. i am a vegan who's been madly in love with three people, angus, matty and pouter--a scotch terrier and two cats. nothing makes me happier than to see animated creatures with personalities, facial tics and accents just as disparate and human as their real-life inspirations. oooooh, inspiration...where's that on the menu?",3.0,1,0

"If I were addressing Blade Runner 2049 as a standalone film I may have been more lenient in giving the film a seven, however since this film is a sequel to Blade Runner (1982), my initial verdict of this film as it stands is a four.Blade Runner (1982) is by no means a perfect film, polarizing reviews at the time of release, a box office bomb and seven different versions of the film over the span of 25 years is enough to put any casual moviegoer off seeing this film within their lifetime. My experience with Blade Runner started with the director’s cut in 2005, I found it was boring, contrived and didn’t watch it again until nearly a decade later. Whenever I watch a film my objective opinion on whether a film is good or bad is never subject to change, however Blade Runner is an anomaly and upon repeated viewed of both the director’s cut and final cut my view shifted from hate to love for this film. Blade Runner (1982) is not a film in the conventional sense but instead an experiment, filled to the brim with story, culture and lore it has inspired countless sci-fi and neo-noir projects since its release. Blade Runner 2049 however feels more so like a conventional film and while it captures the Blade Runner look, the feel is lost in translation boiling down to a movie that’s excessively artificial and overall ‘okay’.Blade Runner 2049 opens with ‘K’, A Los Angles Blade Runner played by Ryan Gosling tasked primarily with the job of ‘retiring’ The last of the Tyrell corp. Nexus 8 units who have exceeded the Nexus 6 lifespan of four years to more open-ended lifespans like human beings. While on a job K discovers an old and dark secret left behind by Eldon Tyrell's played by Joe Turkel in the 1982 film, Tyrell corp. that threatens the co-existence of human and replicant societies. All the while a darker force is at work by the name of Niander Wallace, whose Wallace corporation have since succeeded Tyrell in replicant manufacturing. What follows is a heavily long film at 2 hours 48 minutes that travels from location to location, with visits to familiar faces such as Rick Deckard played by Harrison Ford in the films second half to ease that nostalgic itch. Performances in this film vary tremendously from actors such as Ryan Gosling who easily carries the film and weaker performances from actors such as Jared Leto who once again blows his role out of proportion to be the films biggest ‘douchebag’. Actresses such as Robin Wright and Ana de Amras pull great performances in addition to actors such Dave Bautista plays a memorable performance as Sapper despite his small screen time. Harrison Ford feels a lot less versatile an actor as he did in the original Blade Runner but is otherwise enjoyable to watch as an older Deckard who seems to be tired from it all, desiring seclusion in his later life. One of the major realms this film comes apart in is the story. As stated before this film is very long at 2 hours and 48 minutes in comparison to its predecessor which is less than 2 hours long. While the outline of the film is promising and the first third of the film feels like a Blade Runner movie, the remaining two thirds make things needlessly more complicated as new side plots and locations are introduced that aren’t particularly interesting nor necessary in conjunction with the main story. The romance is another issue I had with the film and without spoiling much a scene between ‘K’ and Ana de Armas ‘Joi’ is quite possibly the most awkward romance scene I have ever witnessed in film. Furthermore, the films conclusion felt quite choppy and while topping Rutger Hauer's ‘Tears in rain’ monologue is by no means an easy task, the lack of existential questions or room for thought like the original film, leaves you more included to go ‘huh’ then question what it means to be human.Another issue is the films soundtrack, while I can’t see why they didn’t get Vangelis back for the sequel considering he is still both alive and active, Denis Villeneuve instead hired Jóhann Jóhannsson to compose the films score. What we’re left with is a score that is fairly meh and isn’t all too memorable, many of the films dramatic scenes aren’t benefitted by the newer music and as a result you don’t tend to take much notice of the soundtrack. Part of me also thinks that Villeneuve found the soundtrack was underwhelming aswell as tracks from the original film are still used in certain sequences of the film. It is also worth noting that this is not the original soundtrack too as Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch were brought in to modify the soundtrack.As it stands until another viewing Blade Runner 2049 is an okay film by itself but is a less than stellar sequel that I think in time people will forget about it.",4.0,1,0

However, with it being a year since it's release, this existing doesn't feel necessary. Pretty forgettable as no one is talking about it (expect for me).

"A group of death row co-eds volunteer for a scientific suicide mission in space led by an artificial insemination obsessed doctor (also an inmate) to collect energy from a black hole and are forbidden to have sex with one another. Unsurprisingly, the ship's specialized masturbation chamber can't keep them satisfied and the resulting sexual frustration mixed with the unethical experimentation taking place and the whole crew realizing that ""hey, this situation sucks, I hate everyone around me, and we're never going home"" leads to a breaking point full of murder, rape, and self-inflicted loss of life. What is surprising though is that the movie doesn't get interesting until all this stuff passes and we're left with the sole survivor taking care of an infant.The concept of a science-fiction movie about a man raising a child by himself in the total isolation of the final frontier with no hope of outside support is a compelling one and I wish that had been the focus of the movie rather than all the other stuff. Instead it's just used as a means of delivering a message about beauty blooming from tragic circumstances. Which kind of works, but a lot of its power is robbed by the story being told in a nonlinear manner. High Life literally opens with the protagonist already struggling to be a parent on his own and makes it very clear that everyone else has died beforehand. So when the narrative starts playing catch-up to show us how he arrived in this position, not only is there no tension in the proceedings because we know every character's ultimate fate, but worse it all feels rather pointless as we were informed what the big takeaway is supposed to be at the very beginning.These missteps mean that the plot isn't able to generate the level of interest it should, which leaves the film to rely on its visuals and imagery to try and captivate. There are certainly moments that will capture your attention and stick with you long after the credits have rolled due to how graphic they are. However, High Life has a problem here as well in that there simply aren't enough of them. The most memorable of the bunch, a grandiose display of self-pleasure, takes place relatively early on making the rest of the running-time a bit of a slog as most of what follows isn't nearly as shocking or disgusting as it thinks it is outside of the regular appearance of semen onscreen. You also have to consider that all of this is taking place to convey the horrible things humans are capable of when horny, frustrated, and have no release. Not exactly original territory. Where it succeeds the most is on the design of the ship itself. The drab, almost rundown looking corridors and bunking really reflect the hopelessness of these criminals venture, with the garden offering the only source of happiness or potential in the surroundings in the same way the baby does in the lead's life.I can see why this has received so much praise, and I definitely appreciate what is was attempting to do, but it fell short for me in a few key ways. The primary one being how it was told. Had things of played out in chronological order I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Given the feature's fixation on carnal desire, I think the best way to describe it would be to say it shoots its load too early. The climax occurs at the start rather than after a steady build-up of pleasure, preventing what little sentimentality there is at the conclusion from being able to satisfy.",6.0,0,1
"Ok, let's talk about Da 5 Bloods, Spike Lee's new film. The plot of this film is very interesting, it's a really innovative story. This is a film that has a very strong message, which may well be applied in this difficult time that we are living. The first act of the film is very well done, with a good introduction of the characters and a great filmography. The film ends up changing its resolution constantly when moments from the past enter the plot, and this is very interesting, since a real sense of the past is passed on. The second act of the film starts very well, bringing a great introduction of mystery, but, unfortunately, the film does not end this act perfectly. The film ends up hitting some holes that end up leaving the film completely confused, causing a certain annoyance. The last act also fails to close the story perfectly. Da 5 Bloods is certainly not a bad movie, it is a movie that can trap you in history. Spike Lee's direction is very good, as well as the performances, which are incredible and bring a very beautiful emotion to the characters. Cinematography has its great moments, especially in the most open planes. But unfortunately, the film has some completely unappealing characters, which add nothing to the plot. In addition, the film ends up dragging more than it should in some scenes. To conclude, Da 5 Bloods is a film that manages to send a great message to the world, has great performances and a decent direction, its biggest problems, are restricted to the secondary characters, and the unnecessary extension of some scenes. But even with the defects, it is a film that is worth your time.",7.0,0,1
"Finding Dory fails to top it's predecessor in every single aspect. With the forgettable and thrown together sub plots to the mediocre main plot ""Finding Dory"" really can only depend on it's new characters to be somewhat good. Ellen as Dory was so heartwarming but for the rest of the main characters from the first movie. Well they make themselves as unlikeable as ever. Marlin comes off as a jerk in the movie and Nemo comes off as a nagging toddler. The movie really shines where new characters like Hank and Destiny come in. They are some of the funniest and most visibly and virtually endearing/impressive characters in the movie. With Hank's attitude to Destiny's jokes I feel that more than ever did Pixar do a good job with new sidekicks. This movie is only a slightly better Cars 2 and that's the sad truth. It takes a character that was literally meant for comic reliefs into the spotlight. Finding Dory did it better but they really left her disability at the door for a lot of scenes which I think it odd for a movie about acceptance of people with disabilities. The end of the movie is what seals it has a disaster to me. There's a line for what's realistic in a movie like this and they crossed it by a New York mile. Overall there were some laughs to be had but the movie had me feeling as good as ever to just watch the first one again.",7.0,0,1

" Ponyo should run with the following disclaimer: Warning! Do NOT go to this movie expecting another Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away! If you are going to see Ponyo, note that this film is firmly targeted to the pre-tween audience. I am an ardent fan of Miyazaki's work, but Ponyo is the weakest film of his that I have ever seen. Yes, the visuals are stunning, but the story lacks the depth we have come to expect from him. Even Miyazaki's earlier works that are mainly targeted towards children (such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service) easily best Ponyo in plot and character development. If Pixar has taught us anything, it is that you can have all the beauty and all the technology in the world thrown up on the screen, but in the end, it comes down to the power of the story that makes a film great. The overzealous voice acting by the American actors further tarnishes Ponyo. Before Miyazaki was ""discovered"" by Disney, the less star-powered cast of voice talents used in the US versions of his films did a much better job of avoiding too much verve in favor of subtlety and color. Miyazaki is truly one of the all-time great masters of animation. It is a terrible shame that Ponyo may be his final work.",4.0,1,0

As to the end of the film, what can I say but that it is truly amazing.  The closest movie ending I can think that compares is the end to Cannonball Run when Captain America/Captain Chaos rescues a woman's dog and he and Burt Reynolds lose the race, but win the moral victory.  The parallels are indeed almost frightening and I wouldn't be surprised if Christopher Nolan eventually reveals that Cannonball Run (and its precursor, Smokey and the Bandit) was his template for this movie.

Through their journey through the city of Berlin, they touch the lives of many with their presence. Though many are unable to see them, children can. With just a touch of these angels hands, they are able to heal the thoughts of people (the man who commits suicide and help comfort the woman in labor). Although this movie may sound interesting, it is not. The movie becomes dull in some parts. For example when the conversation at the bar between Damiel and Marion runs on for so long or when we are stuck watching Marion's trapeze routine for what seems like an eternity. These too long of scenes it what ruined the movie for me. Overall I would not recommend this movie if you enjoy exciting, action-packed, funny movies because you won't get that out of this one.",3.0,1,0

The only complaint is the ending, the end twist is what disjoints the movie, its an EXTREMELY small twist, that doesn't start developing till LONG after the plot has run its course.  The main complaint with the end twist, is how predictable and boring it is, it also gets right down corny at the VERY end.  The ending brings a top notch 9/10 or even 10/10 movie, down to a 8/10.

"The story of a main character with a seemingly impossible dream, fighting his way to top, is one that is very familiar in cinema, perhaps especially in Hollywood. It is therefore refreshing to have a movie that tells the story of someone who never really makes it; sadly there is not that much else to this movie. The movie is to a certain degree structured in a classic rise and fall way, but without the rise ever really being that great. This all works fairly well, though I would have liked to perhaps see more of the fall. I can to a certain degree understand why they have chosen to focus on the rise more since this is perhaps where it is at its most unique considering the character does ever quite make it. That said, it is still the eventual fall which explores this aspect the best. During the rise everything quickly becomes quite repetitive, which is somewhat effective in that it does explore the repetitive existence of a DJ trying to making it, yet it also becomes thematically stagnant and thereby kind of dull. The acting is very mixed; I would say that for the most part it is good, but it occasionally feels very unnatural, especially during english-speaking scenes. It should also be mentioned that the movie is a tad tonally uneven, especially with the constant Daft Punk jokes, which most of the time feel very out of place, a few well-placed ones would have been enough. Like its main character, the movie tries hard and means well, but in the end it just doesn´t really work all that well.",5.0,1,0

"You can either love or hate Wes Anderson, or you can love and hate him at the same time. Unfortunately, The Grand Budapest Hotel has torn me apart. It is undeniably perfect Anderson: obsessive and strict design, colour palettes, composition, framing and blocking. However, it is essentially missing something; my emotions traversed from sheer boredom to stifled laughter to disorderly admiration. My conclusion is that Anderson has become too overworked; I dislike him for this, yet at the same time a part of me admires the man for his precise ingenious. The film starts and immediately you taste Anderson’s stop-motion style with precise camera panning and boxed framing. The film then jumps through three prologues of time, with the familiar Anderson narration and expose of shots, until we land ourselves at The Grand Budapest Hotel between the wars in a fictional state of Europe. What follows is a story of chapters with crimes, chases, mischief, rivalry, envy and even slapstick comedy. It is all tightly wound and then released like a chasm, the chapters seem somewhat disjointed, the acts become emotionally sterile and ultimately there isn’t a chance for the story to coerce. We are presented with the same Anderson, but also a new Anderson. He presses on his comedic roots and concentrates on the physicality of funny. M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) is the prime consent for this, and Fiennes is brilliantly on key creating a few treasurable notes of laughter. On occasion, this isn’t just through material act, but also sharp, witty and almost obscene dialogue. In one scene, he utters to the new lobby boy (whose elder self is predominantly narrating the story – F. Murray Abraham). “When you’re young it’s all fillet steak, but as you get older, you have to move onto the cheaper cuts.” If you like Anderson for his melancholic charm and grounded representations of struggling individuals in a fantastical yet realistic world (think Moonrise Kingdom and The Royal Tenenbaums), then don’t have high expectations for this, you won’t get what you came for. This film is being highly applauded (a reason for my great expectations), yet for all the same reasons, the obvious stylistic reasons. I haven’t seen a single review commenting on how they related to the story on a personal or cultivating note. Are we focusing on a cinematic story here, or what appears to be a theatrical and all-too whimsically clever telling of one? Lastly, I will mention what is palpable and largely unsettling: the ensemble cast of great name actors all battling for a screen spot. A great cast list can give a film much admirable credit, however Anderson has gone a bit overboard here, with Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray and Owen Wilson popping up for five or so minutes, the story becomes even more fictitious and preposterous. I won’t list the rest of the cast, simply search it on IMDB or watch the film, but it is certainly remarkable yet somewhat heedless. It was a muddled evening, and to be honest I am still rather mystified amidst my contemplations on the film. Frankly, I was disappointed and the film is no more than what Anderson’s lavish style makes it. One might say you are better off trying to watch it inside out.",5.0,1,0
"11 years and 20+ movies and it all builds up to a meh of a movie.It was average. The good parts were good, the bad parts were really, really badJokes were excessive in what should have been a dark film.Ant-man coming back after 5 years shows Marvel Studios don't even care about their own continuity. If 5 years in real life is only 5 hours in the Quantum Realm why was Janet old in Ant-man and the Wasp? People still mock the Martha scene from BvS but let's be honest, the ""Cap freezes up and stops fighting when someone mentions Bucky"" nonsense is way worse than the Martha scene. It's used AGAIN in this one. It's ridiculous.They borrow from Dragon Ball Z for how time travel works, that way they can mess with time with no repercussions.Widow's death was emotional manipulation, and ultimately felt forgettable after the fact. Tony's death was the only really good part of the movie because it felt like the right way to end it, especially knowing how the MCu started with Tony being a selfish playboy.Steve somehow can go back in time and live out his life and be old in the present, with no changes to the current timeline? It's so stupid. And he gives the Shield to Falcon? Ugh. They really are going full SJW with future movies, aren't they? Forgettable movie. It was average at best and as usual the critics show how biased they truly are where they call this movie ""Once in a generation"" when it's just another MCU movie that is meh at best. Rotten Tomatoes also shows the bias used to protect the scores of MCU movies (not just them deleting negative audience ratings for Captain Marvel but legit critic score they manipulate). One critic gave the film a 2/5 but their review was labelled as ""Fresh"". Mind you, a 2.5 for BvS was considered ""Rotten"". Amazing how that works, isn't it? How a 2/5 is Fresh but a higher rating is somehow rotten for a non-Disney comic movie? But there's no bias (sarcasm)They further ruin Hulk and Thor, and seeing Hulk dab had me ready to walk out of the theater. I gave this a higher score intially but remembering the dab brought my score down from a 4 to a 3Seeing Captain Marvel easily destroying a full powered Thanos and shrugging off his blow like it was nothing shows how big of a Mary Sue she's really going to be in future films. And I honestly believe before hey did a bunch of reshoots a few months ago she beat Thanos and saved the day, and after seeing reaction to her character and Larson's comments against a large chunk of their potential audience they changed it to Tony stopping Thanos with the stones to keep from alienating more of their fans with that shoehorned in character.This should have been the end of the MCU. But the franchise prints money because of people like the guy who made headlines for seeing Captain Marvel 116 times and the guy last year who saw Infinity War over 100 times in theaters. So bad to average movies will continue to dominate box offices, prompting other studios to follow suit, meaning the days of good filmmaking will continue to fade into memory",3.0,1,0

" I just finished watching Avatar in boring old 2D. I expected that without the gimmicky glasses the film would lose most of what people are raving about (see Beowulf) but darned if that wasn't an awesome film. I saw Titanic in '97 and though the visuals were incredible, probably the best until Avatar, I felt that the story was too hackneyed to ignore just for the sake of special effects. Avatar has come in for some of the same criticism from some viewers, but though there isn't anything really new in this plot, it's surprisingly well written, at least for a big budget action film. But of course the story only needed to not be annoying, because the real reason everyone is going to see this film is the visuals, which even in plain old 2D are enough to make Lucas's last three space operas look like something out of Ed Wood's filmography. Only Lord of the Rings has come close to creating an entire world with this level of detail, and some of the same folks are on board for this film. But they have really outdone themselves. The only negative reviews I've seen from non-critics have been from conservatives who are offended by a movie that says we shouldn't rape and pillage native peoples and pristine environments.

"One of the major advantages of having a theatre like The Classic Gateway Theatre is that you get to see most of the independent films and will come across a stunner now and then but that is not the case with “Summer 1993”. Based on the true story of the director and screenwriter of the movie Carla Simon we follow 6-year-old Frida (Laia Artigas), upon the death of her mother and father, sent to live with her mother’s brother Esteve (David Verdaguer), his wife Marga (Bruni Cusi) and their 3-year-old child Anna (Paula Robles).We watch Frida as she adjusts, or doesn’t, to her new life and how her new family adjusts or doesn’t, to this addition into their home. Unable to understand or vocalize her pain Frida lashes out in awkward, sometimes dangerous and, other times, bewildering ways.I missed an important factor in the movie which is primarily explained in the title and the last 2-3 minutes of the film which became obvious about a few incidents that take place in the movie. I don’t usually give spoilers in film reviews and I won’t here but I am more surprised that I didn’t catch on to this.In spite of that disclosure, I didn’t find “Summer 1993” interesting enough to recommend it though Laia Artigas as Frida gives a natural performance and you can feel what she doesn’t seem to be able to express.",3.0,1,0

"A mixed bag. Though The Revenant is an exceptionally well presented visual showpiece, it is also entirely nonsensical, ham-fistedly delivering its narrative, which like its protagonist's quest, is entirely devoid of any deep significance when it's through. This is mostly due to a disconnect in logical proceedings, which wouldn't be too big a deal if the film wasn't attempting a realistic portrayal of the world. From the moment of the bear attack all suspension of disbelief is totally gone, leaving you only to shake your head as Glass survives countless fatal situations, and crosses roads with so many people important to plots surrounding him purely by coincidence. Oh, it's because he's the best tracker that side of the country, now it all makes sense -- except for the part where he's been shredded to ribbons by a bear with only wet clothes on his back and in the forty below nights of the frontier. While the visuals and soundtrack accompanying the dream sequences were some of the highlights of the movie, I felt they became a bit heavy handed, adding different visual themes without any real substance. Some leaps in logic cast doubt over the final events of the movie, which really sticks out over whatever symbolism the filmmakers were trying to achieve with those scenes. Without spoiling anything, I will say that the climax of the film is well executed, which is good since it was the only really big payoff to look forward to. As good as it looks, it's never as immersive or as symbolic as it wants to be with its cliched and nonsensical plot, as well as few noteworthy performances. Special commendations go to Tom Hardy, who excellently portrays the only well established character in the entire film. His character is the only one I found to have inspired any curiosity, and that's a shame since he's the villain. Some great visuals aside, it's a miserable experience that strains your senses (particularly your ability to hear what characters are saying - my experience seemed to have a very poor sound mix with muffled, mumbling voices).",5.0,1,0

"A classic love track, sound track, gag reel and simply smart filmmaking.The CircusI think I can go ahead and say that this is my favourite Chaplin feature. I wish I knew why and I don't either. The writer, director, actor and composer Charlie Chaplin has struck gold in this adventure. The germ of the idea was definitely the change in location and spreading still the same humor, humility and belief. And yet, it remains unfiltered for its sweetness. No matter how accurate and magnanimous your vision is on pulling off a dark gritty drama, it would rarely add to the ""I wish.."" list for its ""beware"" and ""wit"" tingling sensation in you. While this sweet love story like this has legs that goes for decades and even centuries for it catches you with big fluffy pillows as you fall down with gullible likeness in mind.A bread and an egg, the story starts from and it is where it ends. And yes, I get that some might even find this heartbreaking, but Chaplin's genius in the last act of the film, was that he satisfies you with such absorbing themes, that by the end you don't really care how The Circus will finish the show. The product is gift wrapped and delivered to your doors as soon as the last act begins.The key is to never go beyond anyone's perspective other than Chaplin's. And this was all drama. The rest of the fill in, are fabulous gags that looks like Chaplin has installed to test himself as an actor, a performer. From enacting like a robotic puppet to multiplying himself on screen to bossing around his opposing co-star like a mentor. Over the years, the only issue I had was with the do over process of the interview of his job, until I realized this time that those mandatory gags were not actually for the laughs, but a showcase of his commitment on the hard work that he inadvertently cares for.",9.0,0,1

"""Humans are weak for their emotions"". I can't agree more with that statement after watching the movie. If the movie ever moved you, then congratulations -- you have lost your rationality. Don't let emotional outbursts override your rational thinking.Now, calm down and reevaluate the whole movie. The core conflict is presented by the first scene: Music vs. Family. But have you ever realized that these two isn't a conflict at all. You CAN enjoy music while having a loving family.However the director chose to show us a stubborn mother. Music is BANNED forever only for a family member left forever -- she don't have to, since that will be a irrational choice. Let's return to reality: Will you ban cooking forever if a family member got badly hurt and died while preparing dinner?Also what REALLY disappointed me is the final wrap-up song ""Proud Corazón"". This sentence is repeated twice: ""Our love for each other will live on forever"". So: the director believes that the message of this movie is to promote family union? Well, that is WRONG! I think it's about compromising and accepting.why? That's because the family never ripped apart in the first place. Hector is already planning his return to his family and let's use our imagination: if Hector returned to the family, will music still be banned? Obviously, not.The reason why most audiences think a happy ending would be appropriate is that since the ""Remember Me"" music made Coco remembered Hector, music is accepted by his family and Miguel received his freedom to play music, which, have no connections at all with family reunion.However, these flaws won't stop the musics included in this movie to be enjoyable. But since a movie has its mission to let its audience learn something from, too musical will be inappropriate.I don't think this movie will be Oscar worthy. But it should be good for an age group of 5~7.",3.0,1,0

"I cannot understand why many people rate this film very highly. Nothing happens, literally. The end is the same as the beginning albeit with the addition of Bob Dylan playing on stage. Big whoop. I understand the meaning behind this; if you don't change anything about yourself or your situation then you're destined for repetition. Don’t get me wrong. The music is quite good and captures the essence of that era. Isaac has a beautiful voice to boot. But you’re probably better off buying the soundtrack instead of seeing the movie. Each performance in this film is certainly impressive and I wouldn't be surprised if Justin Timberlake does a folk music album. Back on the film itself was disappointed by the supporting cast. Everyone is quite suitable in their roles but we're not given enough time to care they appear. Llewyn is the main character and it makes sense he is the focus. However he is unlikeable because he is definitely annoying and unpleasant. I commend Oscar Isaac for nailing that. The two main women in Llewyn life have permanent PMS because they are always annoyed or angry so well done for showcasing realistic women. As for the rest they're onscreen and then they're gone as they don't matter to the story, considering there is little story to tell, they're just passing by. To the audience they may as well not have appeared at all. One exception is John Goodman as the vicious jazz musician. His appearance is a highlight for me, particularly on how he describes how talent-less folk musicians are with their limited, simplistic use of music: ""C, G, C"".... folk music hasn't changed much in 50 years. And that leads me to this categorization of this film: comedy-drama. Really? I realize categorization helps people classify something but this is not a comedy drama. First and foremost this is a drama, with a different and interesting setting, with some comedy thrown in to lighten the melancholia throughout. It isn't laugh out loud comedy either, rather it gives us quite a few snickers, giggles and chuckles. My lasting impression is that hype has helped sell this film and this hype has blinded many to believe this is a terrific film. It isn't.

MLK's character was disappointingly underdeveloped, and the pacing was pretty slow, especially the last half hour (and I'm typically not a fan of history lessons to begin with). Also, I couldn't help but feel like this movie was a bit pointless. Race relations are certainly contentious these days, but EVERYONE at least realizes that voting equality is a no-brainer. If this movie is trying to make a political statement (which is probably the case considering the song during the credits), it's not going to change any opinions. However, if it's merely supposed to be a historical lesson, then it serves its purpose, although it is certainly not the first of its kind.",6.0,0,1

"I never liked this movie. It's based on a book I have not read yet, I've never found it for sale, so I can not judge if it was true to the book. However, most people seem to have a consensual opinion that this movie is brilliant and one of the best ever made. It's a nuisance movie in its very nature, as it tackles too brutal themes. It basically speaks of extreme violence and the possible ways to control it through brainwashing and absolute control over people. It's a world that no one really wants to see. If violence is something we condemn, extreme violence is disgusting. The total conditioning of a person reminds us of the times of slavery and the man as object. These are ideas that our civilization, at great cost, has learned to hate, but we all won with it. These themes would make an excellent movie and this movie would have been great if it did not overdo it all through barbarically graphic and unnecessary scenes! And the film gets worse as it shows to the public plentiful bursting and destruction, accompanied - surprise, or perhaps not - by scenes of nudity and almost explicit sex. Stanley Kubrick filled the vast majority of his films with generous doses of blood and semen. He has always seemed obsessed with all this, and I am sure that Freud would make a rather interesting analysis of that, so why would it be different in his ""magnum opus""? In the midst of all this monument to madness, we must recognize that the film tackles a complex subject and has an interesting history, although it is so abject that it ends up not worth the effort to watch. Perhaps in the future someone with courage will remake this movie in a more restrained manner, without exaggerate. We also emphasized Malcolm McDowell's excellent performance. The actor, still relatively young, went to the limit, accepting things that I, in his shoes, would not accept, and manage to maintained the interpretive level and shine. For this, he deserves congratulations.From the point of view of detail and technique, its possible that this is one of the best films ever made. But we are too shocked to notice and appreciate. And the truth is that cinema is not only technique. The audience does not fill the theater to admire the way the camera moves, the color and light of cinematography, the quality of characterization. The essence of any movie is the story told and, in this case, it's the story of a nightmare. Does the conception of a cinematographic work of art need, necessarily, to shock or cause erections? In the past, art was beauty and perfection, and I still think of art in that way. Does art now have to be deformed, sexual, pornographic and bloody?

"I'm just gonna start by saying I grew up with the original animated feature, which did have it's flaws and definitely wasn't faithful to Rudyard Kipling's original story, but I still liked it a lot. As for this movie though, I'll start with the positives. The film does look amazing and surprisingly realistic! Even though it is obviously CGI and at moments can look kind of fake, but on the whole you could swear the movie was shot in a real jungle. And I also like most of the actors they got to portray the cast, most notably John Goodman as Baloo, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, and especially Christopher Walken as King Louie. The only one I didn't really feel was Scarlet Johansson as Kaa, but aside from her I feel like they all bring their own unique charm to these classic characters. With that said, the movie as a whole I thought was just okay as there are some problems that hold me back from considering it great. For one, there are just some things that don't make sense, like how come the elephants can't speak when every other animal can? Mowgli brings up briefly how every animal has a ""language"", but then apparently that means wolves, panthers, AND bears can all speak the same language? And also I thought the ending was kind of a cop-out. The original movie ended with Mowgli and the animals going their separate ways, as that was what was best. Here, Mowgli just ends up staying in the jungle and all the animals are cool with it now. Plus, the scene where Baloo is intentionally mean to Mowgli to convince him to leave felt kind of forced. On the whole though, it's not the worst movie ever or anything like that, and I won't hold it against anyone if they think it's a masterpiece. For me personally, I simply thought it was okay, and I definitely prefer the original movie that was fully animated... But maybe that's just my nostalgia talking.",5.0,1,0

"After releasing a film every three years since 2004, director Edgar Wright's latest effort comes after a four-year gap due to his flirtations with Ant-Man. Baby Driver, an action film about a man named Baby (Ansel Elgort) who is a getaway driver, is perhaps Wright's most commercially appealing film. With the box office to match and the film shaping up to a box office surprise to many this summer, it seems as though Wright has finally found some mainstream acceptance, at least in America. As with many directors who finally escape niche audiences and finally find themselves receiving applauds from the general public (without having to resort to their work being a ""cult classic""), Wright has unfortunately compromised some of the frenetic fun of his early work. Though Baby Driver is nonetheless a quirky, funny, and often times surreal film, it winds up feeling wholly underwhelming with Wright ditching what made his earlier films work so well: characters.Though Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz were both action comedies, they nonetheless had great central characters. The supporting cast got the same treatment in those action films and this was especially true in his other works, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and The World's End. Unfortunately, this latest work gives very little for any character. Baby, a music-loving kid with tinnitus and who is in love with Debora (Lily James), is given very little depth even as the star. Beyond having a black foster dad and dead parents, it is hard to imagine what was supposed to be learned about the kid. He does not really grow and is never really given room to explore any bit of him beyond brief flashbacks to the car crash that gave him tinnitus and killed his parents along with a cassette tape that has a recording of his mom (Sky Ferreira) singing. Too often, Wright seems to rely upon old school musical classics as a shortcut to actually write dialogue between characters or characters' backstories. It is often excusable when the supporting cast is lightly developed or if a film fails to develop many characters beyond narrative cliches when there is not a single protagonist. Unfortunately, beyond being a good kid with a bad past that has led to him being bound to crime boss Doc (Kevin Spacey) as a getaway driver, Baby gets no depth or nuance. As a result, it is easy to just roll your eyes with how pale he winds up being written.This same problem is found with the entirety of the supporting cast. His girlfriend, Debora, is shown as being nothing more than idyllic yes man who does whatever Baby tells her to do. Leave work now? Sure. Travel the country right now with a guy you barely know? Sure. Let this guy just follow you home? Of course. She has no ideas of her own. No volition and, crucially, no motivation. Wright, likely, keeps it this way to make it easier to turn her into a stone cold badass at the end with her taking on Buddy (Jon Hamm) and trying to outrun the cops. Neither are convincing moments with how she is set up as nothing more than a young girl trying to make a living at a dead end job. Wright treats her as arm candy, lets her have a moment towards the end, and then reassures the audience she is nothing more than a dream girl from a song and relegates her to being nothing more than cute for trying to save Baby, but let's let the men handle this one, eh? For Doc, he suffers from the same issue, but in reverse. Though he does seem to always like Baby, his turn from a hard-nosed criminal who will never let go of Baby to a soft and sentimental man who sacrifices himself to save his beloved driver is borderline comical. The film may be an action-comedy, but its absurd and ludicrous suggestion that Debora could go from quiet waitress to being Bonnie and Doc could go from being a true monster to being Sulley from Monsters Inc. carries no water. These two, despite their vital importance to the plot, are woefully underwritten. For bank robbers Buddy, Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), and Bats (Jamie Foxx), they are similarly underwritten. All of them are crazy and impulsive with no depth for any of the trio ever being considered. They are just nuts and cannot be trusted. With them all being treated as villains of Baby by the end, this cast of underwritten villains makes it apparent why Wright wanted to work with Marvel: his lack of knowledge of how to write a capable villain would be welcomed, instead of questioned. The only saving grace with the villain is a good motivation for why they become the villain, but it comes off of the back of too little development until then to really make it click.",6.0,0,1

Cliff beating up a Manson Family member for puncturing his tyre, and 3. The final scene where Pitt trips on acid and beats up the Manson Family members in Rick's (Leonardo DiCaprio) house, effectively cancelling the Tate murders. Everything else in the movie is just conversations after conversations that I couldn't appreciate and even link to anything besides understanding that Rick's a washed out sad sack of sh*t actor, Cliff's a loyal lapdog who probably killed his wife, and Sharon's dancing/vanity. All actors acted well, but Margot's Sharon Tate was the most useless--only being a dancing bimbo. DiCaprio's a washed out actor who keeps getting mad and sad at himself, and Pitt's his loyal stunt man. Of all three, only Pitt scenes gives more entertainment as compared to the constant rant and conversations with (all) other characters in the film. The conversations also are extremely boring and a chore to watch and listen as they serve no purpose whatsoever. Or I might be born too late to actually live through and understand this cinema age and lifestyle of the celebs shown in this film--whatever it is, it's a bore. Heck, even the final scene where Cliff (Pitt) defends Rick's (DiCaprio) house was a tad dark and unable to really see the violent and gruesome effects--which is what Tarantino's films is all about. Only the final scene here has that signature scene of Tarantino, and even that's not delivered at it's best to fully appreciate. It's just a grind.

"This movie / documentary inspired me to delete almost all social media apps from my smartphoneand I only use social media sporadically now.

"It amazes me how the American public can buy into propaganda.  I saw the movie and as a work of art it is pretty good.  But the story it tells is more fiction than fact having a loved one who participated in the event.  But why should that stop a liberal Clint Eastwood from rewriting history?  Time heals all wounds and it is nearly 70 years since the event took place.  Most of our brave American men are now presumbably dead and have no way to respond to this attrocity portraying the Japaneese as the good guys fighting with honor.  What is so bothersome is that Japan has a history of Sneak Attacks long before Pearl Harbor.  In 1905 it is true that the sandbagged the Russians at Port Arthur and then planned to destroy their Navy again after the initial Sneak Attack which they were very successful in doing.  This led us into WW I.  HIstory repeated itself on Dec. 7, 1941 a day that used to live in Infamy, that is before Clint Eastwood decided to change things up?  If you don't learn from history we are bound to repeat it.  I have to laugh as we now commence wars (i.e. Iraq) by asking we are going to bomb you on Monday is that good for you?  Can you imagine the world's outcry if America ever Sneak Attacked anyone?  But I am only someone who is aware of the terrible things that the Japanese did to our boys at Iwo Jim;  but who am I to argue with Clint Eastwood how honorable the ENEMY was?  If you want to buy into this propaganda then by all means enjoy the movie.  As I said it was a good movie from an artistic point of view and on that there can be no mistake.  But to rewrite history and have people feeling sorry for the truly bad guys is just a bit too much.",0.0,1,0

"Engaging and funny at times, but works too hard to set up its contrivances on the one hand, and then takes furious short cuts on the other. Such as a car chase where the main character can't be going more than 50 mph and claims she's flooring it, and then fakes out all the police by simply hitting the brakes. Mistakes like this, or like the cheap gimmick of the main character throwing up whenever she tells a lie, are so far into silly territory that it gnaws at the credibility of what is in many respects a meticulously crafted murder mystery.The other problem is at some point the twists start to feel a bit too predictable and rote, and the reveals start to lose impact. At some point, to earn its due, Knives Out had to fool the audience and it just never really does. Most of the supporting cast is quickly off the suspect list and the only thing that makes us still care about them is the actors' performances (which are generally quite good). No, the problem with Knives Out is solely in the writing.Also Knives very cheaply injects politics as a way to turn the vilification of the antagonists up to 11 and ennoble the protagonist. It's pretty stunning how tacked on and lazy it's done here. With the film's ""critics insurance"" paid, I'm not surprised at it being rated more highly than it probably deserves. Watch the over 40 years old Blazing Saddles if you want to see a movie that does it right.",5.0,1,0
"If there is one film that defines the notion that ‘no coming of age story can be depicted too late’, it’s Gloria. After getting divorced and watching her children’s lives take exciting new turns, whether it be raising a family of their own or exploring new career opportunities, Gloria could have easily fallen into a sad life, alone and miserable. Instead, wise, beautiful and full of life, Gloria decides to live her life to the fullest by working hard and playing even harder. Whether it’s dressing up to go out dancing, singing aloud to her car stereo, or doing yoga for the first time, Gloria gives new life and meaning to the ‘coming of age narrative’. As the audience follows a character whom, at a much later age, still endures the ‘coming of age’ trials that we mostly see in preteens or young adults, Gloria brings to light many of the trials that countless women face today. Sadly however, Gloria becomes a very specific, dreary, and essentially uneventful character study intended for a very specific demographic with very little to offer larger audiences. As a film critic responsible for representing the voice of younger film enthusiasts and a new generation of film lovers, I have an appreciation and understanding of the opinions of others. With that said, I approach every film unbiased, informed and open-minded, as I would with any piece of art. Now, there are very few times where pieces of cinema actually become timeless pieces of art. I believe, that in order for a film to be timeless, it must reach leaps and bounds beyond it’s key demographic and speak to people, regardless of it’s time-frame or the age of it’s characters/subjects. In many cases, films speak to the audiences they are targeted to, hence why most films are surveyed by demographics based on age. Films like Blue is the Warmest Colour, Something’s Gotta Give and her, have very specific viewing audiences and are able to succeed (critically and financially) by marketing themselves appropriately among these demographics. Every so often, there comes a film that roots itself in certain time-frames using a specific age-centric voice/or place in history (fictional or non-fictional), and becomes a universal piece of cinematic language. Recently, films like The Social Network, The Past and Nebraska, not only become film pieces that are embedded within a specific time-frame understood by a few, but effortlessly speak volumes to many. Unfortunately, Gloria becomes a very specific tale of hope for divorced middle-aged men and women in search of love, sex, and meaning after the life they always thought they’d share with someone falls to pieces. The most fantastic element with Gloria is her ability to avoid melancholia, however what’s discrediting to the film altogether is that it’s underlining feeling is melancholic. Gloria’s loneliness is her biggest downfall as a character. Her dependency on the company of others leads her into a relationship with Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a man who flaunts his wealth in order to attract Gloria yet basis his own happiness on her simple beauty and effortless sex appeal. With the loud ring of each of her phone calls and his quick answer, Rodolfo quickly becomes a foreshadowing of his inability to please Gloria’s endless appetites–both inside and outside the bedroom. It is through Gloria’s relationships with others, including Rodolfo and her daughter’s boyfriend Theo (Eyal Meyer), that both she and the audience is able to explore the colourful sides of her multifaceted personality and youthful demeanour. Much like the main titled character herself, the film experiences a change of heart halfway through, and then again abandons those thoughts not long after. The film has much to say about a woman who’s unquenchable sex-drive and lust for passion are thwarted daily. Her quest for love and romanticized notions of affection are held next to the ideals of the songs she sings on the radio and within the small discos and dance halls where she meets men. After all is said and done, Gloria still seems to find her appetite unsatiated, not for a lack of meeting men, but instead as a result of the preconceived notions she has about the world of cougar dating.",4.0,1,0

"An enchantress disguised as a beggar woman arrives at a French castle and offers a cruel and selfish prince a rose in return for shelter. When he refuses, she reveals her true identity. To punish the prince for his lack of compassion, the enchantress metamorphoses him into a beast and his servants into household objects. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the spell will only be broken if he learns to love another and earn her love in return before the last petal falls in his 21st year, or else he will remain a beast forever.Years later, in a nearby village, a book-loving and an independent-minded girl named Belle dreams of adventure and wants more than the little village can offer. She is seen as an outsider by the villagers. Her appearance attracts the attentions of Gaston, an ill-mannered and narcissistic hunter whose advances she has to brush off, as well as his bumbling sidekick Lefou. On his way to a fair to showcase his latest invention (an automatic wood-chopper), Belle's father and inventor Maurice gets lost in the forest and seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for trespassing. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search of him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place.Belle befriends the castle's royal servants: Lumière the candelabra, Cogsworth the clock, Mrs. Potts the teapot, and her son Chip, the teacup; they invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the enraged Beast scares her into fleeing the castle. In the woods, she is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her and is injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a friendship develops between them, they become close and even get close to falling in love. Meanwhile, Maurice returns to the village and fails to convince the townsfolk of Belle's predicament. Hearing Maurice's claims about the Beast, Gaston hatches a plan: He bribes Monsieur D'Arque, the warden of the town's insane asylum, to have Maurice locked up as a lunatic. Belle, with none to support her, would then have no choice but to marry Gaston. Before they can act, however, Maurice leaves for the castle to attempt a rescue alone.After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father collapsing in the woods using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror as a remembrance. After Belle takes her father to the village, an angry mob led by Gaston, Lefou and Monsieur D'Arque arrive to arrest Maurice. Trying to prove Maurice's sanity, Belle uses the mirror to reveal the Beast to the townsfolk. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston has her thrown into the basement with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast. With the help of Chip (who had arrived at their house as a stowaway) and Maurice's wood-chopping machine, Maurice and Belle escape, and then rush back to the castle.During the battle, the Beast's servants fend off the villagers and LeFou. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too heartbroken from Belle's departure to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston stabs the Beast with a knife and falls to his death after losing his footing.[a] The Beast dies in Belle's arms before the last petal falls. Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast and the spell is undone, reviving the Beast and restoring his human form along with all his servants and his castle. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.",7.0,0,1

"You Were Never Really Here is the story of an ex-FBI agent turned hired gun named Joe (Joaquin Phoenix). He has been hired by a senator to track down a 13 year old girl who was kidnapped and to inflict as much pain on the kidnappers as possible. But in his attempts to track them down, he seems to fall down a rabbit hole which leads to nothing but more violence and pain. However this story is rarely the focus and instead offers Lynne Ramsay to explore who Joe is and the horrible memories that plague his mind. As a hit-man he’s very effective, taking down his targets with nothing more than a hammer, some duct tape and a plastic bag. But as a person he is a fractured individual who is unable to escape the demons from his violent past.This past as rarely talked about, but instead we have to piece his past through brief glimpses of the person Joe has become. We see this through the physical scars on his back, dark memories of an abusive father and sudden flashbacks of the horrors he witnessed whilst working as an FBI agent. There are often times when Joe will be doing something as mundane as waiting for a train, when we’ll suddenly get the distinct impression that he’s seriously considering jumping on to the tracks. In spite of having relatively little dialogue, Phoenix’s performance sits alongside the greats like Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver or Christian Bale in American Psycho as a portrait of a man who is unable to escape the dark thoughts which are plaguing his mind. His constant detachment to almost everyone around him mixed with his look of pure anguish shows the hard life he has put himself in, whether he deserves to be there or not. Oddly enough, in spite of how much death and violence happens in the film, we rarely see these acts of violence on screen. Instead we are often left with the visual aftermath of this violence, along with the physical and emotional scars that Joe carries with him. It distinguishes the film from other detective thrillers and mixed with Jonny Greenwood's pulsating score perfectly capturing the rhythm of the films hypnotic imagery. But the main thing that shines through the film is Lynne Ramsay’s vision of this painful life. She never relents on the cold atmosphere of violence that Joe seems to be trapped in and through this creates a powerful feature showing a damaged life, but still somehow leaves enough light at the end of the tunnel to make us think that some kind of redemption or release could still be possible.",9.0,0,1
"Chinese writer/director Yimou Zhang’s ‘Shadow’ is largely an example of a trailer being better than the film itself.  The trailer is captivating, leading one to believe the movie is going to be mixture of martial arts fighting and palace intrigue.  However, the full extent of the film is largely unbalanced in this regard, with most of the runtime bogged down with political maneuvering and the action sequences only ramping up towards the last quarter of the movie. What stands out most is the strikingly beautiful set design, featuring a stark black and white color palette inspired by the ancient Chinese painting tradition of ink brush.Yet the most challenging aspect of the movie is trying to keep track of the plot’s myriad twists and turns.  It’d assumably be easily to do if one were fluent in the native language.  However, trying to follow the labyrinthian storyline is exceedingly difficult given the fact that the plot is dense and the film is subtitled.  As a result, we’d recommend watching 2016’s ‘The Handmaiden’ instead, which is a better representative in the genre.",6.0,0,1

"While Best of Enemies is a documentary  it could have easily been turned into a movie as it  views like a dramatic story that works towards a climax at the end of the ten headon collissions between the progressive liberal Gore Vidal and the (neo) conservative William F. Buckley. The exchanges are cloaked as debates with the intent to comment on the national conventions of both parties in 1968 prior to the elections, but are more like verbal brawls. They remind me of  the Nixon vs Frost interview in the way it exposes the participants in full view of the television audience. But these are not interviews, commentaries , debates or exchange of ideas. These are dirty below the belt catfights of the most shameful kind. The apex is reached when Vidal entices Buckley  to fall into a trap and has him commit the worst of acts that ends all debates: to turn to threats of physical violence. It is the word cryptonazi that does the trick, foreshadowing the famous Reduction ad Hitlerum fallacy in a way: any debate ends when Hitler or Nazis become an argument in the discussion.  When Buckley recoils from his own rage Gore gives him a supreme smile so thick with glee that it even shames his supporters: he has gotten what he wanted, that is: to expose the 'real' Buckley that lurks under the charming  veneer: a lout, a ruffian and a brute. But at what price? After Gore carried away the flag in triumph, his initial victory turns into pyrrhic one and overtime becomes a  sound defeat for the nation, so the documentary has it. For these representatives of two opposing political worlds are not without influence, Vidal being an famed writer, essayist and commentator and Buckley  important publicist and more on less on of the founders of the neo-conservative movement. And their fight does not end with the last of the debates. Instead in extends up to the death of the two into the 21st century. The distaste and hatred that isolates influential groups do nothing to make that country more stable. It would go a bit too far to state that this debate is the root of all evil , but it shows for the public eye something that was already in the make: the rising antagonism between (neo)conservatives and progressives that hijacks a nation. As the documentary has it: coming into being are two worlds that hardly communicate. It is hard to judge if the documentary is biased, but it states, and this is impression I got, that Vidal went into the debates with the sole intent to tear down Buckley and what he stands for. Buckley seems to have had less of a purpose, but he quickly geared up. Yet I got the impression that Buckley was more honest and more personally affected by these discussions than Vidal was. The latter struck me as a cold calculating bastard to be honest.  But maybe this is because Buckley seemed far more charming than Vidal was.It is sad to know that one man can hate another so much as to state the fact in the public eye. And it is sad that to see how people lap this up. And this is probably the weakest part of the documentary. It doesn't tell us much about the fanning of the hatred. It never tells us that nobody had the decency to tell them to stop or that ABC gloated because of soaring numbers of viewers. The documentary basically forgets about those large masses who were drooling over this live soap, foreshadowing the downfall of television as a serious means to inform and educate a nation. For when ABC got the most viewers with their entertainment,  the other networks, with their boring serious distant coverage of the conventions lost theirs. And they saw what was happening and adapted. The documentary is one of the best I  haves seen and therefore quite unsettling. It not only concentrates on the debates themselves but glances at what happened before and how Vidal and Buckley fared after and gives us an impression of the participants. I would certainly recommend it, even if it is not a pretty sight.",9.0,0,1
"I hadn't watched or read any Shakespeare material since high school, and walked out the theater awestruck. I think I only got about 80% of the dialogue, but this was definitely the ""watching the first shakespeare play"" experience that critics talk about that I never understood. The set pieces and the action and combat scenes are expertly done, the visuals alone could carry this movie. Unfortunately the modernization didn't work 100% of the time.

My only other issue is the child acting, sure Noah Wiseman is better than most child actors, but that does not mean his performance didn't suck me out of the movie every now and then.

It's action packed and entertaining but I preferred the suspense and tension of the first film.

The two elements never mesh well and cause inconsistencies as characters act one way one minute and another the next without it every feeling seemless. Over the two sides the playful homage is preferred with familiar songs, a familiar soundtrack, and voices that capture the spirit of the original characters. Unfortunately, all that is lost as likeable characters are made unlikeable, the threatening made unthreating, and a cobbled messed.

"This movie continues the story about the infamous Batman, a.k.a Bruce Wayne. A new mob has formed and the new D.A is Harvey Dent. The movie begins with a bank robbery by an unknown group of robbers. Later into the robbery, it is revealed that these robbers are working for the Joker. It is also revealed that this is one of the Mob's banks. Each robber, disguised in clown masks, is given an order to kill their partner when are finished with their job. That leaves two clowns standing, one which is revealed to be the Joker himself. A stolen bus is used to carry away the bags of money. When Lieutenant Jim Gordon arrives on the scene, they find video of the Joker taking off his clown mask. This scene kind of points out who the main antagonist of the movie will be. Gordon also discovers that this money is indeed ""mob"" money.    You soon find out the members of the mob, when the Joker interrupts one of their meetings. He states what is his and should be the mob's objective: ""to kill the Batman"". Later, he announces that if the ""real"" Batman does not turn himself in, then there will be deaths starting ""tonight"". The first deaths are Commissioner Loeb, and a judge who formerly tried members of the mob. Harvey Dent, the District Attorney, was attempted to be killed. The next day, a death threat against the mayor is made in the obituary section of the Gotham newspaper. Gordon and his team stand guard as the memorial for Commissioner Loeb is being held. The honor guards turn out to be the Joker's men and they all attempt to shoot the mayor as he speaks, but Gordon pushes him down and is shot.    Barbara Jim's wife, is notified that he is dead. After those deaths, Bruce Wayne decides to adhere to the Joker's wishes and turn himself in. When Harvey Dent holds a press conference, the Batman is revealed to all to be Harvey Dent. Of course, this is incorrect but Harvey announces that he is, before Bruce can say it himself. Harvey is then attempted to be captured by the Joker while he is being transported by a Detective Ramirez. This fails, and Harvey and his girlfriend Rachel Dawes are transported by cops Ramirez and Wuerst in separate cars, while the Joker is captured by a supposedly deceased Jim Gordon.    Harvey and Rachel never get home however, and are instead sent to separate locations in the city. The Joker soon escapes from holding, but before he does so he gives the location of Rachel and Harvey, switching them around, telling them that they are strapped to drums of gas, rigged to blow. Harvey and Rachel are given a phone to communicate with. Batman goes for Rachel, while Gordon and his team go for Harvey. Batman ends up saving Harvey, but not before half of his face is burnt by the exploding drums. Later, the Joker announces that the city will be his in a matter of hours. Gordon sends a ferry of prisoners and a ferry full of civilians away from Gotham. It is revealed however that the ferrys are rigged to explode and each ferry is given the other ferrys detonator as part of a social experiment by the Joker to see who will blow each other up first. The location of the Joker is found and Batman soon captures him. Harvey kills the cop that drove him to his location, based on the flip of a coin, and captures Jim's family.  Jim's son is almost killed before Batman shows up, unintentionally killing Harvey. Batman then tells Gordon that he and his men will have to has him, and that marks the end of the movie.    This movie was great, with an excellent plot, terrific villains, and characters you really care for. Even if yo are not a Batman fan, it is still a must see movie.

"Director Christian Petzold and actress Nina Hoss have now brought us a string of accomplished films exploring Germany's past and present, culminating with the extraordinary BARBARA. What a disappoint it is to report on PHOENIX. A metaphorical conception of a concentration camp survivor given a new face (literally) only to come back to Berlin to follow her husband, the man that betrayed her. PHOENIX is worthy of Sirk or Fassbinder. Petzold's direction is without merit and he gives one of our best actresses nothing to do. A total misfire that I found downright dull.",6.0,0,1
"Very sorry to have to say that The Master was a major disappointment. This one LOOKED like a ""no-brainer"" based on the brilliant trailer, the tremendous cast, and being written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, whose last film, There Will Be Blood, was one of the most artistic movies of the 21st century. Although the story starts off intriguingly enough with Joaquin Phoenix brilliant in the role of a WWII vet struggling with a severe case of PTSD, once things soon meld down to essentially Clash of the (psychopathic) Titans (Phoenix vs Hoffman), the story never really goes anywhere, other than to provide Oscar bait scene chewing scenes for the two male leads. Don't get me wrong, the film LOOKS great (cinematography, sets, costumes), however, the overall feeling I was left with (at least 40 minutes before the film even ended) was frustration and disappointment of what COULD have been. This one is strictly for those interested in seeing some interesting acting choices from Phoenix, Hoffman and Adams. Past that,... I fully expect The Master to be expelled from theaters before Halloween. Save this one for your Netflix que,...if that. Grade = C-.",6.0,0,1

"I didn't know who Anurag Kashyap was before I saw this film. And my mind was blown. This is the best gangster movie Bollywood has ever made, and that's saying something since Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai also exists.When the film begins, it seems like it will be the same old, generic good guy vs bad guy movie. But as the story progresses, the line between the good and bad people blurs to the point where it doesn't exist anymore. In the beginning it feels like Sardar Khan is supposed to be the hero, but slowly he's shown to be a terrible person who gets in fights with everyone and marries a second time just because he's getting horny.Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Faisal is introduced in the second part after the demise of Sardar Khan. The bad guys really make you feel like killing them, and the way they speak is very reminiscent of the villages from Bihar and east UP. The acting by literally everyone is phenomenal, such that it inspired memes for years to come, and that's being in a good way. Every scene has been choreographed so well it actually gives you the feeling of those poor, low class families from suburban areas.It doesn't matter how many web series come up - Mirzapur, Paatal Lok, Sacred Games.

"I’ll never envy Tarantino for always having whatever he does compared to the likes of Pulp Fiction or Inglourious Basterds. Making one film as good as those is extremely difficult; following it up is even tougher. That being said, this one is definitely one of the weaker in Tarantino’s filmography, despite a gorgeous look and two very good performances from its lead actors.I think what ultimately kills this film is the aimlessness of its dialogue. This is Tarantino style dialogue, to be sure, but it isn’t quite Tarantino substance. Whereas in his other films, the dialogue is wandering and seemingly pointless at times, there was always a purpose behind every word. I don’t feel he was able to capture that cohesiveness that his other films managed to obtain. It’s not a terribly made movie, not at all. It just isn’t great.",6.0,0,1

It starts off with some nerdy guy who gets selected for a project, he gets transported to a place in what seems to be far from society.   He meets his boss which seems to be a bro and never likes talking about specifics because he made the AI using ""magic""  then the nerdy guy develops a bond with the ai in like 10 minutes of talking, the questions he asked are very stupid.   Never did he once think that AI is something we shouldn't be messing with without huge safeguards including for a good programmer he never thought of the implications of the experiment.    He ends up falling for her in like 5 interviews and he tries to help her escape.    There is a part he cuts himself to see if hes a ai.... He didn't really show he was in pain even though he was cutting himself, I would expect it would hurt.Then there is a part with the bro explaining it was all part of the plan, and then the nerdy guy is like HA I tricked you! I really did it before you knew and then the robot got them both!Then the Bro boss meets the robot and the other AI stands still and he walks into it, Yeah that happens you ever back into a knife.. it doesn't do that, regardless its like a 2 minute exchange and she ends up stabbing him anyway....  Then she goes outside without any safeguards she just escapes without any effort. This movie is worse then transcendence,    Its not a horrible movie it just really lacks any actual thought of AI.

"I'm really surprised by this film's score here. I haven't felt as much let down by critics since Disney's Star Wars reboot.The film is a jarring mixture between documentary and fiction. It's set in a part of the United States where poverty forces people into nomadism. This seems sad on the surface because it makes you work in unglamorous jobs and live in your car (that's probably the documentary part of the film?). But it's really the best thing ever (which is probably the fiction?). You constantly meet really great and warm people and form deep relations of mutual gratitude. Being a nomad you end up having to leave, but since they are also nomads you bump into them everywhere. Some of them are not so good at sounding profound, but it doesn't get worse than that, and they only try this maybe two or three times in the film. The hardest part in keeping up this lifestyle seems to be turning down the rich people who constantly offer to house you for free. Maybe this is a particularly privileged part of the US. That would explain why there are no black people to be seen anywhere.This could still be a good fiction if it actually managed to bring the human stuff to life, but this did not work at all for me. In the least convincing scene of the film Fern suddenly becomes judgemental out of nowhere. The writers follow this up with a scene where Fern's sister praises here ability to ""cut through **** Having served its purpose as an attempt of giving weight to the relation between the sisters, this aspect of Fern's personality promptly vanishes from the story.

" Whilst Downfall is undoubtedly a compelling and intriguing telling of the final days of Hitler it is not one without serious flaws. Firstly the good points; the acting is superb with Ganz's in particular standing out for his study of a monster, touched with just the right amount of humanity, swinging between delusion and despair. This combined with the great care which has been taken in accurately recreating the settings and consumes gives the film and harrowingly real feel. However the film is marred by the script bowing to convention and including a protagonist with whom the audience is supposed to identify in the form of Hitler's Secretary ..... The film wants us to believe that she was at the heart of events in Hitler's bunker whilst simultaneously suggesting that she was a picture of innocence and ignorance. The scene near the end of the film where she seems shocked by Hitler's statement of revulsion of the Jew's is utterly ridiculous and insulting considering she has been his personal secretary for two and a half years by this point. The final part of the film which shows a clip from the documentary 'Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary' where she talks of her apparent shock of finding out about the holocaust through the Nuremburg trials and how she as absolved herself of any wrong doing because she was young and naive (she was 25 at the films conclusion!), which is given to the audience without anything to question it as there is in the original documentary, leaves a very nasty taste in the mouth.

"What starts out promising to be an unusual examination of old age between two married gay men soon veers of into a different area entirely by introducing sub text about familial responsibility. The film has an air of artiness about it which is undermined by pedestrian plotting and drawn out scenes which lead to obvious conclusions. Fine actors John Lithgow and Alfred Molina provide some lovely moments, but in all honesty both have been better. This is rather surprising considering the possibilities these roles afforded them. They come across as just to knowing. Only Marisa Tomei really impresses in what could have amounted to a nothing mother role. In her hands she manages to build bricks without straw and is quietly brilliant.The film is also not served well by a score that tends to embalm the drama rather than eking out its subtleties. Following the demise of a key character emotions are evoked successfully, but the subsequent ending is stranger than the love story in this earnest little drama ever is.",5.0,1,0

"I would consider it offensive if this was labelled simply as a '100 minute commercial'. It may be made involving a corporate franchise, but it is there to teach, not to sell. The LEGO Movie uniquely combines smart sharp satire towards examples like pop culture and consumerism, a charming voice cast voicing a whole array of interesting characters (if you look close enough, some of the characters parody the usual stock characters) and a morality tale. It not only subverts tropes, but also subverts expectations right until the end. It's difficult to see a film just once, especially when it contains so much humour and wit when mocking things left right and centre. Everything I feel about this film is exciting. Animation can show itself to stand out in throwing out a non generic message involving politics, business and culture. The villain himself shows the audacity as a president to not only demonstrate his nefariousness, but impose his own ideologies with no room for creativity. Not only that, but the LEGO Movie also plays on the cliches of many outrageous tropes - how does it work out when a simple, ordinary construction worker is suddenly announced as the centre of the prophecy as 'the Special'? What happens when he encounters someone considered to be the 'manic pixie dream girl'? The split personality of the Good Cop Bad Cop is refreshing when it comes to two distinctively defined cops interrogating someone, and the gleeful decision made about Green Lantern after his film ultimately failed is dark but amusing. However, when it comes to happy endings, even that doesn't remain the same. Even for the villain himself. It doesn't spit out the usual kind of messages - whether on the scale of the morality tale or the satire surrounding politics and the like.",10.0,0,1

"Kubo and the Two Strings is the new Laika movie and after the disappointment of Boxtrolls, this is a renaissance back to the time of Coraline and ParaNorman. The story, as always, show us a kid as protagonist, who is gifted and will have to face supernatural forces in order to prove him/herself the inherent value of his/her uniqueness. Here, the storyline is a quest for solving a family conflict, enriched with moments of self-discovery, acknowledging family relationships and learning the importance of memoirs and ancestors. With captivating plot-twists the dynamism is maintained and the protagonist’s process never becomes too dense or tedious. The problematic is without questioning, at the ending, when everything falls in the trap of an animated picture, resolving the conflict childishly and very quickly in order to get everyone happy. When comparing with the outcome in ParaNorman, where forces of good and evil preferred to talk and good showed evil how things actually were with the objective to teach instead of defeat; Kubo did nothing of that, although it could have. Besides that, the most outstanding achievement of this film is the stop motion and visual effects, where body movements and facial expressions are just basics; the natural flow of hair, fur, clothes and origami figures made it a work of art; and the job with the antagonist put this movie in a museum.",8.0,0,1
"Let me start by saying there were elements of Gravity that I enjoyed, but I felt it was lacking in some regards. Here are my thoughts. May contain spoilers! Gravity (Ailurus fulgens), also called lesser velocity and red quantum physics is a small feature film native to the eastern space and southwestern  space that has been classified as Vulnerable by IUCN as its wild population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals. The population continues to decline and is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression, although red gravity are protected by national laws in their range countries. The red velocity is slightly larger than a George Clooney. It has reddish-brown Oscars, a long, shaggy budget, and a waddling Sandra Bullock due to its shorter front legs. It feeds mainly on outer space, but its galaxy eggs, birds, insects, and small mammals. It is a mainly solitary film from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day. The red velocity is the only living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. It has been previously placed in the science fiction and horror  families, but results of phylogenetic research indicate strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family Ailuridae, which along with the Clooney family is part of the superfamily Musteloidea. Two subspecies are recognized. It is not closely related to the giant velocity. Still not as good as Left 4 Love.",2.0,1,0
"Can you say ""expectation greater than realization""? Everything is there from a great story of intrigue, danger, love, hate, friendship, families,betrayal, life and death. Then add some of the greatest stage and screen actors around. All this should have been fodder enough for the most thrilling roller-coaster ride of the Harry Potter series of movies EVER! But what did we get? A movie that was as yawning and emotionally void as a teaspoon. Sure, the pyrotechnics and special effects were A+ but what happened to the roller coaster of emotion and tension, happiness of reunited families then sudden death and unhappiness? Percy's reunion with his family to join the fight would have been well worth an added five minutes to the length of the movie. Here is the up ride of the coaster in one second to joy, happiness and forgiveness and as suddenly as Percy is back, Fred is killed! Down goes the roller coaster screaming to despair, out come the tears horizontally!Another great scene that went missing was MacGonagall giving Slughorn the basic ""grow some b.lls and fight or get out of the way"". A simple rousing speech by her, at this point, to rally the troops to fight  would have had the audience cheering and the students' blood boiling to save their beloved Hogwarts! But no, the fight begins with a ""send Slytherin to the dungeons!'. Seriously, that was no battle cry!Once the battle started, there were few students and others to be seen actually fighting. The movie could have added another five minutes to focus in on a fight here or a death there. Even the great battle from the book (many were waiting to hear the 'B"" word) between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange would have sent the coaster car careening up to the top of the ride before crashing down with Bellatrix's death (which by the way was more of a whimper than the fabulous death scene it could have been - slow motion added here would have further crossed the T on her death!).A few other things could have greatly enhanced this movie: Voldemort actually dying in front of the whole school, Hagrid and Grawp fighting outside the castle and then Hagrid getting carried away by the spiders, and Neville and others carrying dead students back to the Great Hall. Just some simple touches of what made the book great would have made this movie stellar. Yes, the scene with Snape's tears going into the vial then into the panseive was fabulous. I sobbed when he held Lily and thought my heart would break at this truly touching and fabulously added scene. Added scenes would have had the audience on the edge of their seats one moment and blubbering into their popcorn the next. Making this picture longer and not jumping so quickly from scene to scene would have allowed the audience to savor this this truly final film in this fabulous series. What's wrong with a three hour movie for 30 million plus fans? Either the WB was looking at the bottom line or those in charge of production were tired and looking at their watches. Finally, the last scene with Harry and company sending their children off to Hogwarts 19 years later. The music as lovely and teary, but what happened to Ron being funny or Harry being stared at? More lost opportunity. And the roller coast limps to the end of the ride.

As mentioned in other review, the film's cinematography was excellent. I loved the space shots and the micros views of cells. But that's where the good parts end, I nearly burst out laughing when the dinosaurs were briefly introduced.

American Hustle has it all going for it, but most of it seems too cocky amidst O. Russell's freedom here. Most of the humor is trying to make itself laugh rather than us. And most of the drama is trying to appease itself rather than appease us. But there's so much good wine feathered into this pic, that even if you find yourself dazed and confused by what's really going on, you always know it's on the path of critical acclaim, as the movie seems to swim in it's wittiness even if you can't keep up.",7.0,0,1

"The latest from Wes Anderson (and his 2nd stop-motion animation after ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"") takes place in Japan, where a plague has caused all dogs to be transferred to Trash Island. When one boy comes to rescue his pet, it starts a journey that ends in the expected. As is usually the case with Anderson, the art direction is imaginative, inventive and delightful. The story starts with a quirky energy that's fun, but about half way thru, things get a bit precious and the pace starts to lag. This is filmmaker with a singular style, but it sometimes becomes too self-indulgent.  Still, Anderson showcases his unique approach to storytelling, character and visual style.",5.0,1,0

"In 2012, Aaron Sorkin piloted a television program that educated, informed and entertained by nit-picking the issues of modern day television broadcasting, information distribution and most of all, societal perception. Luckily, I was able to stumble upon a clip of the opening monologue of the show via YouTube, which was recommendation by a friend. The monologue, delivered by Will McAvoy, played by the audacious Jeff Daniels, is single handedly, one of the greatest monologues in television history, describing the issues with contemporary American politics, government, its people and most of all, the media. Approaching its third (and final) season, The Newsroom has proved to be a champion of debunking the public’s predictive perspective of hyped up terror scares, exploitation news broadcasting and television, as well as ginned up controversy. With Nightcrawler, writer/director Dan Gilroy feature film debut, the film delivers an almost complete counter-program to one of the best shows on television today, glorifying the exact same things The Newsroom is championing against. Yet, from the first dark scenes of trespassing to the final scenes of pure brutality and unimaginable corruption, Nightcrawler crawls up your skin and into our heads as one of the creepiest and feverishly uncomfortable films of 2014. Nightcrawler begins like any nightmare would, at night. Basked in the sketchy noir lights of an almost unrecognizable Los Angeles, similar to Newton Thomas Sigel’s Los Angles in Refn’s Drive, the night city is consumed by insomniacs and blood-thrity reporters looking to make money and a name for themselves based on the misfortunes and tragedies of others. One of those inhabitants is Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a fast-talking, quick learning creepy night-dweller who takes most of his knowledge and facts from the internet and disposes of his verbal jargon to anyone who crosses his path for his own interests. We first meet the Lou as a petty thief who cuts fences and steals manholes to make his money and earn a living. Bloom is a sociopath, and although we don’t immediately connect with the character, never once asking the questions of how, why and for how long he has been living this life, we never really question him either. After successfully trading his stolen possession to a local scrap metal owner, where he unsuccessfully bargains the terms of an employment position, Lou drives onto the barren freeway in his dilapidated car, stumbling across a car on fire. After pulling over and being mesmerized by the deadly ambers igniting on the hood on the destroyed vehicle, two news photographers crash the scenes with their nightly lit cameras and gear. Like we’ve seen before, Lou is no stranger to awkwardness, since he is as much an opportunist as he is a slimy insomniac, he offers his services to the ‘nightcrawler photographer’ Joe Loder (Bill Paxton). Rejected, Lou still feels that he has finally found his calling and with that, he steals an impressive racing bike on the Venice beach boardwalk in order to pay for a dodgy camcorder and cheap police scanner in order to begin his adventures as an amateurish nightcrawler. The film’s success can easily be accountable to its transformative star Jake Gyllenhaal, who lost over twenty pounds for the role by biking and running to set and reportedly spending up to eight hours a day at the gym. The actor, who has been nothing but superb in a recent string of stirring films from Prisoners, Enemy, End of Watch and Source Code, delivers one of his finest and easily most haunting performances to date. Complete with bulging eyes, an Adam’s apple and veins coursing the entirety of his body, Gyllenhaal proves that the simplest aesthetics are the scariest. Having no regard for human beings and enticing strangers with a jabber that is almost to quick to comprehend, Gyllenhaal’s dedication to the sketchy Bloom is seen both physically and emotionally, as well and felt cold-heartedly and abruptly by its audience. Bloom strives off hard work as he proves, despite his better concern for the law, he is a hustler. Convincing himself as well as everyone around him his potential in an industry that strives off trespassing, seduction and lies, Bloom manipulates everyone for his own regard. Reciting over the same lines, whether it be to a new employee of his company during a job interview to a desperate and homeless Rick (Riz Ahmed), or convincing low-rating news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) of his potential of delivering graphic, unsavoury and somewhat illegal images for her morning broadcasts, Bloom believes that “If you want to win the lottery, you have to make the money to buy a ticket”, by any means possible. With-holding information to the police and pulling on the weaknesses of his prey, Bloom never thinks a second, making him one of the scariest, real people we never want to have the pleasure of meeting.",8.0,0,1

"""Finding Nemo"" along with ""Ratatouille"" and ""Toy Story 3"" are my three favorite Pixar movies (all 10's) out of so many good ones.  That brilliant hit trend started to turn south in my eyes starting about 4-5 years ago.  This latest is finely animated of course and the detail like always is pretty amazing.  However the story is a flat out bore top to bottom!  Talk about retread.  It's an uninspired sequel.At the same time I can understand the problem for Pixar now.  The novelty of 3D computer animation has worn off and since they make all family fare, just how many cute coming of age tales can you spin and keep it fresh, much less going to the vault for obvious money maker sequels whether they warrant making because they have actual new stories to tell?  Don't think having a deep sea fish story wind up in a car chase on land is the real answer.  Sure it's fun and just fine for most young children, but can adults say in truth they were entertained by this?  That it is original and clever like so many of Pixar's past efforts have been?  Hardly. However, the pre-feature short ""Piper"" is a wonderful piece of state-of-the-art animation with a simple minimal little nature story told succinctly and briefly that is impossible not to be impressed by.  Made me wonder if they actually photographically shot the sand granules or they were 100% digitally conjured?  If so the animated look here has reached yet another new threshold.",4.0,1,0
"""IT'S JUST 12 MEN IN A ROOM FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF! BORING! 0/10!"" This is why people love this movie haha.

Yes. Yet it's one of the most riveting movies I've ever seen, few movies have had me this invested. Seeing our main character, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, at the start of the movie being completely alone voting against the execution one by one convincing the 11 other men to vote the same as him is an experience I think everyone should experience.

"Maybe the film went over my head, but I took nothing away from the Master. No feelings, no questions, no discussion. The Master is a film that sets out to tell no particular story, in no particular hurry. The characters are paper-thin, and really only give us glimpses of anything truly interesting. Make no mistake, the acting is superb, but I fear everybody is mistaking the wonderful acting for an overall enjoyable experience, film, and directing. Sure, Anderson tries a lot of different things to make it seem like an important film (shooting in 65mm), but he never made it a captivating one.

"I went to see “Personal Shopper” for one reason only and that was to catch up with the critics who have been raving about Kristen Stewart’s performances in her independent films. I believe I saw her in one of the “Twilight” movies and I was impressed with her performance in “Still Alice” but I had to go to Wikipedia to see what other movies she had been in and they listed 2 movies I had seen, “Panic” and “Café Society” only vaguely remembering her in the latter.The title of the film is Maureen’s (Stewart) job description for a celebrity Kyra (Nora von Waldstatten) who can’t go out without being mobbed. Maureen believes she has paranormal powers as a medium as did her twin brother Lewis who died from a condition that could also affect her eventually. The twins made a deal that whoever died first would send a ‘sign’ from ‘the otherside’.We meet others along the way from Kyra’s lover of 2 years, Lewis’s widow, Maureen’s boyfriend and others but none have almost as much screen time as her iPhone except, possibly, the various laptop computers which are all around.Kristen Stewart dominates the movie whether texting, traveling on trains between Paris and London or motoring around Paris on her Peugeot scooter, being topless for one reason or another and trying to communicate with her brother or being pursued by a mysterious stranger, possibly from ‘beyond’ in that iPhone.Stewart’s face implies more than her words and she easily makes her character believable but I am on the fence regarding her appeal as an actress which in this case may be due, partially, to her director Olivier Assayas. In their first picture together, “Clouds of Sils Maria”, he and the cast received rave reviews and Stewart was the first American to win the French’s Cesar Award for Best Supporting Actress but I don’t see his touch here. In fact, a few scenes that should have had the audience jumping out of their seats, gets very little reaction. Neither does he, or the sound editor, do their job when it comes to the French subtitles or level of some English lines important to the film.“Personal Shopper” did get me interested in Kristen Stewart but at this point not enough to make me go see her future films if there are other films in theatres at the same time that I would like to see for one reason or another.",4.0,1,0
"Fiennes' acting is great, but the direction is fairly eccentric, with MTV-style editing and extreme closeups ala Tony Scott style.The overall movie is pretty gimmicky, it's just Shakespeare with explosions and a modern day set design.

Trying to randomly bring everything to a modern and American setting makes no sense, and keeping the dialog in it's untouched original form means the film is only going to be enjoyable by self-proclaimed Shakespeare fans.This won't be the film that makes Shakespeare interesting or identifiable to you.",4.0,1,0

" I don't know what movie the commentators below saw, but I have to vehemently disagree with the criticisms. Yes, there are certain gaps in the script that are never brought to light, but to focus only on that is to miss the entire point of the film. It's not attempting to be an episode of CSI. It's more of an exploration of the polarities between right and wrong. It reveals humanity in the most improbable places. People need to understand that THIS IS A MOVIE. A piece of art is not intended to immaculately recreate reality, but rather illuminate an underlying message.

"Disappointing film. The depiction of the dawn of the Eighties seemed contrived and inauthentic. De Niro and JLaw are the only performances that feel like they belong in the story. Christian Bale portrays an ultimately sympathetic character with a measure of understatement. The always engaging Jeremy Renner stretches to play a good family man perhaps too eager to help his NJ constituents, but is sabotaged by an Elvis wig the size of Graceland. Indeed, it seemed like the toupées and up-dos should be nominated instead of the actors wearing them. Bradley Cooper goes over the top to the point where you’re not sure if he's sure what film he's in anymore. I agree with other reviewers: I don't feel that the FBI chain of command would just let Bradley Cooper's character have the run of the house so to speak. In fact, it has been suggested that Abscam was the FBI's response to the some of the Washington inquisitions of the Seventies, like the Church Committee.A poor man's re-interpretation of Goodfellas, which is perhaps the definitive depiction of dangerous loyalties and survival in the emerging age of greed as a lifestyle.

There's nothing wrong with that, but despite my attempts to get into the plot, it always went wrong because every once in a while one of the characters would speak words along the lines of and this is how it was back then or I did this as you can see here. Another thing that disappointed me was the music. I can't help but feel like the music just didn't fit. When the music starts playing in The Godfather, I'm right in the plot and I'm completely sucked into the story. Here, the music, other than to enhance the story, was a nuisance to me.

District 9 is a frustrating film. The movie opens with a fantastic set up providing a more realistic and believable version of contact with aliens. This premise could’ve lended itself to a brilliant social commentary on issues such as race and segregation but the film throws that out  the window turning into a dumb action movie with poorly developed characters and pointless shaky cam. If this film had just made itself clear that it was going to be a dumb action film from the start I would’ve been less harsh but the fact that this film opens with such a great foundation to a point where this would’ve been a 7/10 and then quickly throws that a way in favor of running and shooting.

"This is another movie about the Vietnam War. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, its full of violence and shocking scenes, as the director likes. However, in this particular case, violence is welcome, showing us the inhumanity of war, very clear and explicit, from the brutal recruiting of the Marines to the crudeness of the battlefield. It's hard to watch this movie, but this, combined with raw and intense realism, makes the film truly unforgettable. However, this movie is too much like ""Apocalypse Now"".

It's impossible not to observe this similarities without consider how much this film could be more original and is not.

"Let me begin with huge applause for Nolan rejecting the idea of making this movie 3D. Going back three years I have seen on-line ramblers claiming that 3D is the future of movies. I'm only 30, but I know that 3D isn't the future, its the past. Personally, I can't wait for this revived fad to again be relegated to the past. That said, The Dark Knight  Rises is exactly what I thought it would be, a dark conclusion to a dark story. I grew up reading DC comics and always considered Batman to be a more mature comic than many other popular titles. After having lived through Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, I was relieved that Nolan brought back the Batman I loved as a kid. The Bat is not a kids superhero, he is what most adults wish they could be. The kids can have their superpowers, otherworldly planets and genetic misfortunes. Give me an endless bankroll and the deepest desire for vengeance of any other human and I will show you the peoples hero. The Dark Knight Rises does not disappoint. Bruce Wayne may be a billionaire playboy, but underneath he has the courage to fight back, without a burst of Gamma radiation. Hathaway captures the sketchy Catwoman with ease and it is difficult to decipher whose side she is really on. Hardy fits the profile of Bane perfectly and does not venture into the superhuman like his predecessor in Batman and Robin.

You had 3 writers for this movie and the best thing they could do is do a James Cameron, "" Avatar"" movie. That's all it was with the apes as the Navi. Also some scenes look so identical to Avatar and Lord of the Rings. As for the way they portrayed the apes well I didn't believe them. These people should have watched some nature programs on how apes act towards each other, when they see humans, and what they eat.

I think peoples expectations were too high to really say anything bad about this movie since there has not been anything worth watching all year. I think all the CG this summer rotted there brains to actually make any sense on the story.

Not tainted like so many of today's movies with bad language from uneducated script writers that can't figure out a better way to express what is happening.

"An intimate and well-acted film about a journey from marriage to divorce that isn't really more than a high-end documentary. Marriage Story aspires to show the viewer the real emotions and situations of what can actually happens in divorce so you're not going to get a plot twist. The movie essentially sides with the wife as they add the unforgivable bombshell that he has cheated on her. It also never lets him respond to the allegations that he is a smothering, self-involved idiot. She is portrayed as completely justified in blowing up the marriage and dude has to suck on the pain.It's mostly depressing. Any joy or comedy is quickly snuffed out with a new sorrowful revelation. Marriage Story revolves around the emotions and I cannot help but forever process the reasons and details which seemed one-sided and flaky.",3.0,1,0
" I feel strongly that The Nightmare Before Christmas was one of the great films of my lifetime, and that the charm and unrepressable... oomph it had cannot be reproduced in any way. Not even, or most specifically by the original director. Yes, Corpse Bride had the same demi-goth elements that have made Tim Burton who he is today, and Danny Elfman didn't do a completely shoddy job with the music, but it's no longer a first. Nightmare was just that- comepletely unique and overwhelming. I still get cold shivers up and down my body when I listen to the songs, and the concept, however basic, just fit like a jigsaw puzzle to make a master-piece. Corpse Bride very conciously felt like a rip-off, like Burton wanted desperately to have another go with the medium, and thought somehow he could make another classic by just utilizing the same elements. Nope. Sorry. Didn't work. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really good, either. I almost worship the ground Burton and Elfman walk on, and I even loved Big Fish, but I love Burton's films because although each retainting a flavor that very clearly indicating Tim's touch, each movie still remains a completely seperate entity and holds it's own charm. It almost feels like Corpse Bride is a badly disguised sequel to Nightmare, but cops out at the last.",5.0,1,0

Family business as ridiculous as Han Solo’s scene of death.2) The Gollum-like villain.3) Lack of depth, e.g. how Rey discovers she's gifted with the Force and even beats Ren, a master of lightsabering.4) Sloppy video game action in some scenes, e.g. on the ship where Han meets Finn and Rey.

"Lore, (Saskia Rosendahl) is a teenager and the oldest of her siblings including her  sister Liesel (Nele Trebs)  and 3 brothers, twins Jurgen (Mika Seidel) and Gunther (Andre Frid) and still breast feeding baby Peter (Nick Leander Holaschke). It is Lore’s job, after their father, Vati, (Hans-Jochen Wagner) a Nazi officer, is arrested and their mother Mutti (Ursina Lardi), an admirer  of Hitler, voluntarily goes into an internment camp, to take the children to their grandmother’s home 500 miles away crossing mountains, forests, rivers and passing through American and Russian barriers. The mother gives Lore anything she feels her daughter could trade for safety and food from the house silverware to her wedding ring knowing that she will never see her children or husband again.. As Rodgers and Hammerstein so eloquently put it in a song many years ago, “You’ve Got To Be Taught” and Lore, along with her siblings, have been taught to hate all Jews and blame them for everything. As they travel they hear stories about Americans shooting prisoners and throwing them in graves and then producing pictures saying that they are Jews who were killed by Germans along with other atrocious tales that spins the truth on its head. Along their journey the children cross paths with Thomas (Kai Malina), a few years older than Lore, who carries papers identifying him as Jewish though he looks nothing like the man in the photograph. We know very little about Thomas nor will we find out anything except that he goes out of his way to help the 5 children and, more than once, putting his own life on the line. The screenplay by Robin Mukherjee and Cate Shortland, the latter also directing, hit a false note trying to make more out of Lore and Thomas than really makes sense. The moment that Lore lashes out at Thomas with anti-semitic barbs does ring true. The war has just ended, Hitler is dead and all that Lore has been taught to believe may not be true as she takes this journey across a land that shows little destruction as they go through outlying areas and forests.This is a film that comes from a different point of view and shows how innocent children become a part of the world they knew nothing about or dealt with because adults choose to go to war.. Saskia Rosendahl does an excellent job as Lore, a child that is hard to like yet is on her way to becoming an adult in a world that may tear her apart.  Kai Malina is as stoic as an actor can be but still shows in small ways how war affects all. The rest of the cast all exist in a world that at the moment hasn’t any answers but are afraid of what the answers may bring. The direction by Cate Shortland is almost a study in nature, both the good and bad, that surrounds humans but moves a little too slowly. “Lore” holds back too much information regarding Thomas and the grandmother that the children are looking forward to for their salvation hindering the story.",4.0,1,0

"Drive is a movie where you will either love it, or hate it, depending on how well you can tolerate arthouse films. So be prepared(If you ever watch the movie), to see a bunch of scenes where the characters just stare at each other rather than actually talking to one another. Specifically Gosling's character and Mulligan's character. So there's not that much dialogue especially within the first 30 minutes. Even though I'm not a fan of arthouse movies, I loved this one. Though, the title and the way this is being marketed as is very misleading. I expected a movie with tons of action and cool car chasing scenes. That is not this movie. There's little action and really only two car chasing scenes. This movie focuses on the relationship between Gosling's character and Mulligan's character, for about the first hour. Then the last 40 minutes is just a lot of killing, a lot of the killings are graphic and extremely gory. The acting is terrific, the cast does a wonderful job but the two that stuck out the most were Gosling and Mulligan, surprisingly. They were both exceptional, and the chemistry between them was great. I just wish that they could have added another scene or two with Gosling's character and Irene(Mulligan) hanging out together or driving somewhere together to really make the relationship seem even more believable and stronger. I also wish that they would have given Gosling's character a name, he's only referred as ""Driver"" or ""The Driver."" I can see why they did that, I suppose it's probably better that they didn't give him a name but it would have been nice of them to give us a name. I admit I was pretty skeptic when I first heard Gosling playing this type of role, he proved me wrong. I actually can't picture anyone else doing this role but him. He ended up replacing Hugh Jackman, that was probably the best decision ever. I could not picture Hugh Jackman pulling off this type of role the way Gosling did. The story is simple and it kind of annoys me that people are saying this movie sucks because there was hardly a story. Sometimes a movie with a simple story can turn out to be an amazing film based on how well it's told and done. Other times a movie with a simple story can turn out to be total crap(Transformers Revenge of The Fallen). I mean no one seemed to care how Avatar hardly had a story, hell I didn't even care and I liked it. I didn't mind the simple story here because the movie was done so well. It was nicely shot especially during the two car chasing scenes. I especially liked the first car chase scene because you never left the car, it was filmed inside the car the whole time so it was nice to feel like you were part of that experience. The soundtrack for this movie was amazing, if the soundtrack for this movie is not nominated for best score I'm going to be upset. I loved the nice 80's like retro songs. Each song fit perfectly with each scene, and set a nice tone throughout the movie. I especially loved the song ""A Real Hero"" by College. That song just fit so perfectly with Gosling's character and actually added some depth to his character. Though the ending might have been disappointing for some, I liked the way it ended, and let me tell you it's not your normal ClichÃ©d happy ending. It was actually very sad and different. People also seemed to complain about how awkward it was when Gosling and Mulligan stared at each other a lot without saying anything. I can see why people felt that way but it was really only awkward the first time they met and hung out together. Isn't that normal though? They both start to like each other but they're nervous so they stare, smile and laugh at each other. I think it added some realism to this movie. Another thing that seemed to bother people was that Gosling hardly said anything during the movie, especially when he was with Irene(Mulligan). This is true, but they purposely did that. He was originally suppose to talk a lot but they decided to cut away most of his lines, to make him seem more mysterious. I think it was a smart idea of them to do this, it fit well with the movie, and it gives you a chance to try and figure his character out yourself. What was his childhood like? What got him into driving? How did he learn to drive so well? Ect. There's really no wrong answers to those questions and I actually thought about this movie for about a week after I saw it, hell I'm still thinking about it. I think I went overboard with reviewing this movie, I could continue to go on forever talking about this movie and everything that I loved about it but I won't. People who disliked this movie are probably going to think I was on crack while I was watching it but this is a great movie.",10.0,0,1

"Possibly one of the most overrated movies of all time and in my eyes the weakest of the marvel movies produced. All credit from this movie comes from the stunning visual effects and the well crafted score composed by Alan Silvestri, however when the budget is over 350 million dollars, it’s hard for the vfx to look bad. The pacing and tone of the movie was all over the place, and seemed split between going for a lighthearted feel like Guardians Of The Galaxy, or a more serious outlook like Infinty War. The movie was fun yes, but for a decade of build up and being a sequel to the arguably the best mcu movie of all time, Infinity War, the movie fell short in meeting the expections of what I had in mind. They turned my 2 favourite hero's of Hulk and Thor into characters only there for comedic value. A decade of character development just for them to lose all of that in Endgame really ruined the movie in my opinion. The movie suffered from an extreme imbalance between comedy and seriousness, and for that reason I believe it to be the most underwhelming marvel movie of all time.",4.0,1,0

"Oscar Isaac plays a former Army interrogator who is playing with the idea of getting revenge on a cruel man from his past. Isaac is great as always. I can't say the same for Tiffany haddish. She doesn't quite, but almost ruins every scene she's in. When it comes to Comedy, she's the best. But when it comes to drama, she's too twitchy and doesn't seem to know which way to play a scene. This movie is so low-key that it barely has a heartbeat. What we want to see is a story arc where a man who has come to terms with his bad deeds, slowly convinces himself to do justice to a bad man. But most of the movie concerns itself with his quiet life as a card counter. And his relationship with the young man who is pushing him to violence. It's not bad.

"In the Orthodox Jewish religion a woman can’t get a divorce without the husband’s permission and is given a gett in her hand from him that basically says “You are hereby permitted to all men.” This in effect says she is no longer a married woman and returns to the wife all the legal rights  that a husband is responsible for in their marriage. The divorce decree is only obtainable in Israel from a rabbinical court.  In a so called ‘modern’ democratic country it may surprise many that in a marriage a woman has no equality. “Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem”, the Israel nominated Oscar contender for Best Foreign Film, is the third, and a stand alone, in a trilogy of this couple. This is a trial with  Vivianne as the only woman, her lawyer, her husband and his lawyer who happens to be his brother and the three rabbi judges.  Over a period of 5 years we follow her fight for that important piece of paper for her to get on with her life. As the trial progresses, or doesn’t, we learn about the wife Viviane and husband Elisha, their 4 children, their marriage and why she wants a divorce and he won’t give her one. It isn’t until the middle of the movie that her sister and sister-in-law are presented bringing some fireworks to the screen which takes place mainly in a square windowless room with two tables, 4 chairs and the rabbis raised up on a dais, with another table brought in for the witnesses. “Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem” was written and directed by the sister and brother team Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz with Ronit playing Viviane and Shlomi, her husband Elisha. With the exception of 2 impressive outbursts Ronit holds the screen with her very expressive face while Shlomi has a quiet power as he tries to explain himself. Both Menashe Noy, as her lawyer, and Sasson Gabay, as his, support the two impressively. “Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem” tackles an intriguing subject that not many people know about but moves too slowly to be as effective as it could and should be.",5.0,1,0

The depiction of Boston is spot-on, for anybody who has lived there and knows the place. I think it is better than All the President's men. How could it have been better? I think slightly more development of some characters where you felt a bit more personal investment in them, and where you believed even more that they were personally affected by the unfolding events.

"This was a movie that had so much potential, but fell flat in the end. The characters are all fantastic and there is a constant sense of unease and curiosity that you feel throughout the movie, yet it all comes crashing down in the last 10-15 minutes. I almost feel cheated out of experiencing what could have been a fantastically suspenseful film. The Good:- So much about what makes a movie suspenseful is not what you see, but what you don't see. There is a lot of mystery as to whether Goodman's character is just a crazy psychopath, or if he's just a bit of a weirdo that happens to be telling the truth about all the chaos going on outside the bunker.-John Goodman truly stole the show here. He acted a character that, in one moment seemed to be a kind-hearted and caring person whom you felt compassion for, and in the next he was a raging psychopath which made you want to run and hide away in a corner for fear of your life.-Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character, Michelle, was well thought out. She wasn't your typical damsel in distress, but she also wasn't your overly used super strong female lead either. She was a bit in between which I found to be more believable and refreshing.-The cinematography and editing was done very well. The opening scene comes into mind here, in particular. You can't hear anything MIchelle is saying, but you know just about everything that is going on simply by the imagery being presented to you. A phone conversation in which Michelle is clearly upset, to the point of tears, leads to her walking out of the room with her things while the camera pans to a desk with keys and an engagement ring sitting on it. Nothing was spoken, yet you know what just transpired. I love that and wish more movies would take note. The Bad:-Throughout the film, Michelle and her supporting partner-in-crime, Emmett devised plans and schemes which, for the life of me, I could not understand why they didn't just do while Howard was asleep.-They loved to talk so loudly to each other while devising their little escape plans. I felt as though all of these scenes should have had them whispering or writing notes to each other if they truly felt Howard was a threat to their safety and ability to escape the bunker.-All of the above is nitpicking on an otherwise great film. What really had me cringing, however, was the awful ending to this movie. I felt as though it would have been a perfect movie if it weren't for the out-of-left-field moments being experienced in the final scenes. A good movie makes you think after it's over. A good movie makes you wonder what really happened to the characters. A good movie makes your imagination go crazy trying to answer all the questions it didn't. When a film like this relies so heavily on mystery and the unknown, only to suddenly show all at the very end, it takes away all of that post-movie-going-experience wonder that I enjoy so much. It's one thing for it to happen to a bad movie, but when it happens to a good movie, it's truly heartbreaking.",5.0,1,0

"Every year I see 2-3 movies that I have been suckered into whether because of word of mouth or a performance is hailed or it just sounds like something I would be interested in and then I come home to read the critics so I can find out what I saw and/or missed. “Wildlife” is such a film.I am a huge fan of Jake Gyllenhaal which is one of the reasons I came to see this film and though he is perfect in his role sadly he is missing from the middle of the movie. He, Jerry, is the husband of Jeanette, played by Carey Mulligan, and they are the parents of 14 year old Joe, played by Ed Oxenbould.We, along with Joe watch the marriage fall apart, seeing, and hearing, things a teenage boy shouldn’t have to understand at that age. The family lives in Grand Falls, Montana, with Jerry having lost his job and, in desperation, not understanding where he belongs in his life, runs off to fight fires for a dollar an hour.It’s 1960 and Jeanette, after years of feeling dissatisfied, finds herself lost and acts out in ways that are harmful to her son though through his passivity it is almost as if he is a reporter telling a story about people he doesn’t know and the three, including him, don’t know who they or each are.Douglas Sirk, a very successful director from the 1950s and 1960s would have made a very dramatic, 4 hankie picture out of this story but the director here, Paul Dano, just tells the story that he and Zoe Kazan wrote letting the actors do their job.Gyllenhaal does such a good job that when he is off screen, for most of the center of the film, you feel his presence. Carey Mulligan has all the ‘showy’ scenes and is getting a lot of raves but to me she is more bipolar than a woman going through a crisis which I think may be the reason this film doesn’t work for me.  Ed Oxenbould’s 14 year old, in his silence and facial expressions, really is the glue that holds this film together especially when he realizes that his parents are human beings and have faults.“Wildlife”, with some beautiful mountain scenery, is an okay picture though nothing special.",4.0,1,0

"This film deals with a single theme: the shark attacks on humans. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, it has Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss in the lead roles.Regarded by many as Spielberg's consecration film (I don't quite agree, I think E.T. was most notable at this point), this thriller has become one of the most popular films of the seventies, a real milestone of cinema. Honor is made to it's director, who knew how to work the central theme and skilfully use special effects he had at his disposal, even if we think also in the failure he was trying to use that unfortunate mechanical shark. In fact, it was better that way because we have more fear of what we don't see. The actors went well with his role, particularly Shaw. The script was innovative for it's time, being the first to address shark attacks. The sound effects are excellent and John Williams created one of the most impressive soundtracks of all the history of cinema. It's impossible not to feel the heart beating faster when he heard that song that, unsurprisingly, has become a classic. This film won three Oscars (Best Sound, Best Soundtrack and Best Editing) and the Golden Globe for Best Soundtrack.It's not a mere coincidence that Spielberg is one of the few directors who won two Oscars. He is meticulous, inventive, perfectionist and genial. Although this film does not understand why sharks attack people (usually confusing them with seals and other animals in their food chain) and have caused a real stigma against them that still makes them deeply misunderstood, it was able to maintain it's popularity and continues today to be the target of admiration of the public.",5.0,1,0

"The ballad of the politically correct.Guillermo del Toro has earned, thanks to beautiful films written and directed by him, popularity and a kind of veneration that doesn’t make easy to say that one of his films didn’t like with the risk of being attacked by a horde of zombie fans but I don’t care.Photography, set design, costumes, all perfect, but what doesn’t work?The story! One of the most trivial stories I could see, and I'm sorry that it was written by one of the directors I admired most (after I saw crimson peak).As for “Phantom Thread”, the historical period in which the film is set (in this case the Cold War) serves only as a background to tell about  characters that, despite a fantastic story, live our current problems.There's the rub.The characters are all great caricatures, created specifically for tear, smile and prizes.There’s the protagonist that in a petty world, full of prejudices (like today), she cannot deal with anyone except with people on the margins of society like her., and the only relief valve that  she has is masturbation, until she meet the monster; the gay painter out of time in everything he does; the black woman victim of everyone but who finally manages to rebel; the monster: something unknown, therefore an object, useful only for scientific study that can be applied in any way; the bad American agent who would do anything to get a promotion; the Russian scientist who, as he believes in science, is good; the bad Russians of course; the bad and bigoted American society.And I want to ignore the obvious forcing in the script that I want to consider poetic licenses such as: the bad guy with the gangrenous hand standing like the predator, or the bathroom that fills with water without any problem, or the fact that it is very easy to enter in a classified place.I should, as already said, let go many things concerning the script, but when I see characters written in this way my gears grinds.I sincerely hope that despite this success Del Toro won’t touch ""At the Mountains of Madness"".P.S.

"Just want to say that the film is quite good, but it has 2 problems, because of which the pleasure is lost when watching.Let's start with less meaningful - with one person, Brie Larson. This is an absolute misskast for a rather important (?) role. However, replacing CM with any other character would change little. All that she basically does in the film is how cool she is. Well, also earns a tug. Well, the character performed by Bree looks absolutely dead, because she has neither charisma, nor distinctive personal qualities.Okay, stop scolding Bree, because you can do this forever. The second, much more important issue of the film is an extremely weak scenario. Again, it is possible to explicate for an extremely long time what, how and why, but I’ll just say: the film introduces the possibility of traveling in time, without consequences. And this is the all-consuming ""black"" hole of the plot, because of which the meaning is lost in absolutely everything that comes through in the film.

"5/5★ I usually watch teen films with a cynical eye for a few reasons but for the purpose of discussing The Spectacular Now I will mention only two.First off, its hard to enjoy a film when I'm distracted by the fact that the cast usually looks nothing like most teens I meet, and in fact are usually in their mid 20's and even early 30's (Glee, Grease, 90210) with rare exceptions (Freaks and Geeks, at least part of the cast in John Hughes films.) The Spectacular Now features a cast in their 20's but actually look their movie ages, which leads me to my second point: Appearance.Its not unthinkable that a teen should be as attractive, put together and pimple free as so many of these teen oriented films and shows would have you believe but still, most teens don't have stylists and makeup artists polishing their look, so yeah, Gossip Girl and its ilk feel inauthentic to the average teenage experience because of something as basic as looks. Shailene Woodley's bare, makeup-less face is not the only refreshing thing in this coming of age film that has great acting, writing and casting (Bubbles! Coach! Saul!). Most noteworthy of all, the film avoids the clichés usually associated with the genre and is an intelligent study of youth standing on the precipice of adulthood, hesitating to move forward, something most teens can relate to.Verdict: Watch.",10.0,0,1
"The movie is about a programmer, Caleb, who won a lottery to perform the Turing-test on a robot called Ava at the secluded mansion of his employer, Nathan. The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. The testing is done through a series (sessions) of conversations between Caleb and Ava. When we meet Ava, I was struck by her beauty, and observing the comments online, many are as well. But this is where my first criticism starts: the movie is over-sexualized. I'm the very opposite of a feminist. But this movie heavily abused its creative license: the amounts of nudity and sexual innuendo went far beyond reason. The second disappointment of this movie is its predictability. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it's not hard to imagine what's really going on and how it could end up. There won't be any significant surprises. Although a plot-twist will occur, it isn't enough to bring the movie to a higher level. The third problem I want to address are the flaws in this movie. Especially at the end - the finale if you will. Not to mention that some events were just silly. Its one of those occasions where some people are made stupid so the other looks more intelligent. For this movie that's extra bad as its narrative is supposed to be of an intelligent nature. The biggest challenge of this movie is its pace. It's almost non-existent. A big part of the conversations between Ava the fembot and Caleb are simply not interesting, i.e. the conversations don't add value. Just to be clear, having the conversations is the bread and butter of this movie, but too often the things that are said don't hold much substance. The gist has been made clear, so no need to drag it on. So far the negatives. Offcourse there are the positives. First of all, Ava is absolutely stunning. Mesmerizing for sure. Kyoko the maid is very beautiful too. The setting in general, though somewhat cramped is easy on the eye. That's the message I'm trying to bring across. The second positive thing, far more important, is that this movie is thought provoking indeed. It's an intelligent movie, though it's not at the level of, say, a movie like Nineteen Eighty-Four. Ex Machina is pop-science which clearly caters to a younger audience and those who feel confident with the Internet and high-tech. The viewer is not expected to be a deep thinker per se. The most interesting thing about this movie is that it has value once you finished watching. It sticks with you if you're the kind of person who likes to think things over. Now that's commendable added value in my book. I'm neutral about the acting, though Ava, again, steals the show because of her overall demeanor; the right person at the right place. I'm not sure how to end this review as I have mixed emotions. I rate it 4 out of 10 stars because the slow pace holds the movie back quite a bit. And the amounts of nudity is simply too much. It's also too pretentious. I'm confident it has the right to be somewhat pretentious, but not as much as this; the movie is not ""that"" smart. The good thing for many viewers is that it's an accessible ""thinking-movie"". Those are rare. Would I recommend it? I have to say no, though I don't feel good about it. The wrongs of this movie should not be rewarded I feel, despite the presence of some merit.",4.0,1,0

Berlin was bombed not by the USSR, but by the Allies. The USSR, on the contrary, helped restore the ruins of eastern Berlin.

We start with the relationship between a woman and her husband who returns to sign final divorce papers.  He arrives at the airport and goes to baggage claim, but his suitcase has been lost.  She sees him and tries to get his attention but can't.  He finally sees her but there is a glass wall between them.  One expects that this relationship will be examined more in depth.  Instead, we careen to the mother-daughter relationship.  The mother hopes the husband can help with the daughter's worsening behaviors.  We then bounce to the mother-boyfriend relationship.  The mother and husband are going through the final divorce procedure and the boyfriend is calling.  He wants to know if he should accept the husband's damaged baggage which has been delivered to the house.  A critic described the plot as meandering.  I found it fascinating to go down the rabbit hole - but instead of straight down, we are redirected to tunnel after tunnel.  We end in a place impossible to predict.In addition to the roller coaster ride through these relationships, we and the characters gradually learn their secrets and motives as both known and unknown to themselves.  We think we learn the truth, then it is violently ripped away.  We are largely left adrift and with ambiguity, yet the story is still satisfying because it feels real.  Being in the field of psychology, I was struck by the authenticity of the emotions, the misperceptions and the misplaced assumptions.  I believe this movie captures the complexity of relationships, motives and human truth better than any I've seen in recent memory.",10.0,0,1
This is not a horror movie. Whoever said it was a cross between Kubrick and the Exorcist was obviously paid for that endorsement. It is a great historical piece about Puritan America in the 17th century but that's it. It is not a horror movie. It was simply sold to all of us as one.,0.0,1,0

"Some reasons why this movie is great... that the haters just seem to utterly miss. a) Superb cinematography focused on a bleak southern landscape that easily reflects the movie's naturalistic theme b) Motifs such as different portrayals of money determining fate c) Pithy dialogue in which the Coens' derive cornpone wisdom out of people who have seen too much (love the scene with the two retired lawmen in the desert shack near the end) d) Tommy Lee Jones, all wrinkled and angst-ridden about the state of the world when he should be looking forward to retirement. e) lots more but you can read critics reviews to find out what those reasons are. I'm not prone to giving out 10s unless something deserves it. I've seen this three times and it's as perfect as movies come.

Ad Astra is visually stunning but everything else is a bit flat. The early antenna tower scene is reminiscent of Gravity. The plot echoes Apocalypse Now. The “daddy issues” psychology is superficial And cliched - but James Gray obviously thinks it is profound. The final half hour is a major letdown. The meeting of Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones characters is a major fizzer. There is a thrilling moon chase but it feels like it is from another movie. So does the Alien-like animal attack scene. Pitt has his serious face on throughout the film and most of the time he just looks constipated.,6.0,0,1
"An Easy Girl, for the most part, is a well crafted film. It (like essentially anything set in Southern France) is a treat to look at. The sets are pleasant to look at and at times the cinematography is used to enhance the magical surroundings. However, this film suffers from a great deal of problems that end up making the film feel like nothing short of another pretentious art-house film that thinks it has a lot to say but actually doesn't.First and foremost, this film is incredibly predictable. The story presented here is a tried and true one. A character being torn between the innocence of childhood and obscenity of adulthood is a tried and true formula that has been the basis for countless coming of age films. Yet, in this film in particular, it does not deviate from that narrative nearly enough to make this film memorable in the slightest. There are minor quirks that make this film semi-unique, but it ultimately ends up feeling extremely samey compared to a lot of other films. The messages and plot presented in this film are by no means bad or illogical, but they are extremely cliche and thus forgettable.The true tragedy of this film is that it has interesting characters. The standouts for me are Lakdhar Dridi's Dodo and Benoit Magimel's Phillipe. Their characters are well written and are the most interesting parts of any scenes that they are in. In contrast the protagonist, Naima (played by Mina Farid) and Andres (played by Nuno Lopes) are not poorly acted per se, but they are poorly written to be nothing more than a collection of cliches. The only character who is poorly acted is Zahia Dehar's Sofia. As arguably the most important character in this film, she gives a performance that is passable to watch without cringing, but at the same time, does not make the character memorable in the slightest.All in all, An Easy Girl is a well produced film with a plot and message that would be interesting enough were it not done to death already. The performances and writing are both underwhelming, while the artistic direction of this film shines, but as mentioned before, that is not hard when you are set in Southern France. There are better French films you can watch than this one that are much more well rounded (see last year's Portrait of a Lady on Fire and Les Miserables).",6.0,0,1
"How to Train Your Dragon 2 is another sequel works and knows how to follow the story of the Vikings and dragons. Animation have not only evolved, but also the characters evolved. His designs are even better than the first film and animation is even better than the other films Dreamworks and again, the script is fantastic. The dialogues, jokes, drama, everything is great in the script for this sequel. But if, as the former has a problem. And in this case is not the villain (which has an excellent design and is terrible), is the death of the father of Hiccup. I found unnecessary wear and tear because I felt as if the writer and director the sack a part of The Lion King. But as I said before, this sequel has evolved. And it has excellent animation shots when it comes to dragons flying in the sky, or fight scenes or landscapes. In my opinion it is better than the first. And it would be strange that some see this child that felt more like a sequel to teenagers than children. Osea does not have too many adults jokes or insults, it's just that with the evolution of this film felt more for teens. And yes, I think that Oscar deserved. After all, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is another excellent sequel to Dreamworks and I'm looking forward to see his third film.",9.0,0,1

"Interesting and reasonably well-made, but morally questionable in how it presents some of the materialWhat is the primary factor in making us who we are? Were the truly great figures of pure evil - Elizabeth Báthory, Adolf Hitler, Harold Shipman, Peter Scully, Adam Sandler - always destined to become who they became, or are there to be found moments and influences in their environment which turned them into the monsters with whom we're familiar? Is our destiny genetically encoded at the moment of our conception? In short, it's the question of nature vs. nurture. Focused on precisely these questions, twin studies attempt to determine the etiology of differential psychologies in individuals who are genetically similar.And these are the murky waters charted by director Tim Wardle's Three Identical Strangers. However, for me, although the fascinating central story is undoubtedly gripping, there are just too many egregious problems, including an excess of distasteful sensationalism; a dearth of contextualising scientific information; overly simplistic ethical, moral, philosophical, and esoteric conclusions; stylistic drabness; and, an overreliance on plot twists beyond what you would expect of a documentary.The film tells the story of Bobby Shafran, Eddy Gallan, and David Kellman, who, through luck and coincidence learn they are triplets separated as babies. Becoming minor celebrities, they appear on talk shows across the country. However, they and their families are puzzled as to why they had been separated, and why their adoptive parents had not been told they were triplets. Was it a coincidence that Bobby had been placed with an affluent family, Eddy with a middle-class family, and David with a blue-collar family? Did the regular aptitude and psychological tests they received as children, part of what their parents were told was a ""routine childhood-development study"", have anything to do with their separation? What was the involvement of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services? How much did Louise Wise Services know? How was Dr. Peter B. Neubauer of the Jewish Board's Child Development Centre involved? Where was the birth mother?As to the question of nature vs. nurture, initially, events seem to point very much to nature - the brothers smoked the same brand of cigarettes; they had been amateur wrestlers; they had the same taste in women; they had similar speech patterns. However, as the documentary goes on, the argument shifts, with the brothers admitting they over-emphasised their similarities at the time, leading to what seemed a clear win for biological determinism. As time went on, however, their differences began coming to the surface, and ultimately, the documentary argues in favour of nurture.However, how it goes about establishing this argument is questionable, with Wardle sliding more and more into sensationalism. So intent is he on controlling our perceptions that he leaves out a massive piece of information until such time as he deems it pertinent to reveal, and when he does so, he explicitly tells us what to think about it. It's difficult to go into any of this without straying into spoilers, so consider the rest of this paragraph a spoiler. Essentially, Wardle paints the suicide of one of the brothers as unquestionably the result of his adopted father's disciplinarianism, a father who is still alive, and who appears in the film. Wardle does this by cutting from a clip of that father wondering if he had a role in the suicide to one of the other brothers saying, to paraphrase, ""I'm still alive because my parents weren't as strict as his."" Blaming his death entirely on parenting in this manner is facile, grossly overly simplistic, and offensive. In fact, the way Wardle handles the suicide in general is deplorable, teasing it and teasing it, before gleefully revealing it for maximum tabloid-esque shock value.There are other problems, however. Aesthetically, the documentary is drab and dull, almost lifeless. The recreations are bland, and the talking head interviews are flat. Additionally, twin studies are a recognised and accepted scientific practice, but Wardle is so intent on making sure we are appalled at what happened to the brothers that he provides almost no context. If he had spent less time trying to steer the viewers' emotions and more in providing a broader theoretical framework, the film would have worked much better.The story of Three Identical Strangers poses fascinating questions about nature vs. nurture and the morality of certain types of research, but Wardle's subjective opinion comes across far more than it ought. More interested in driving home the shock value than providing a penetrating documentary about free will vs biological determinism, there is little here that you wouldn't be able to find on Google. Given the outrageousness of the material, that Wardle has made such a conventional film is disappointing.",6.0,0,1
"Lets try to compare the classic Pulp Fiction to this film. QT follows a lose formula. To begin, all the actors in this movie are good. In Pulp , much of the story revolved around  Vince Vega and Jules. In this one, Rick and Cliff are the principles. Loose comparison between Sharon Tate and Mia in Pulp but he gave Uma's character much better lines. Robby looks like Tate but thats where it ends. The Manson family sort of a collection of Marcellus Wallace parts. Bad guys but interesting and then of course, Tarantino's famous cameo roles. With Bruce Willis' Butch, Christopher Walken, Harvey Kietel, Eric Stolze, he hit the mother lode. Pacino, Damian Lewis , Bruce Dern, Kurt Russell's characters not even close. In conclusion. I think he got lucky with Pulp Fiction. Its a top 50 all time movie. One upon a Time in Hollywood is a mess and more indicative of Tarantino's true talent as a director.

"With a legion of titles like Pet Sematary, Firewalker, Sleepwalkers, Maximum Overdrive, and Children of the Corn, it's reasonable not to expect much from Stephen King-inspired motion pictures. Adaptations of the prolific author's work typically vary from mildly entertaining to virtually unwatchable. There are a few notable exceptions, however; two of which (Stand by Me, Misery) were crafted by widely-respected director Rob Reiner. While The Shawshank Redemption is not a Reiner movie per se, it is a production of Castle Rock Pictures (Reiner's film company), and ranks among the best filmed versions of any King stories to date. (This statement has not changed since I first wrote it in 1994.) Spanning the years from 1947 through 1966, The Shawshank Redemption takes the ""innocent man in prison"" theme and bends it at a different angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the movie ventures down a less-traveled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars. As one of the characters puts it: ""These [prison] walls are funny. First you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them."" Filmed on location in a disused Ohio prison, The Shawshank Redemption is set in a place of perpetual dreariness. What little color there is, is drab and lifeless (lots of grays and muted greens and blues), and there are times when the film is a shade away from black-and-white (give credit to cinematographer Roger Deakins, a longtime Cohen brothers collaborator). It's ironic, therefore, that the central messages are of hope, redemption, and salvation. First time feature director Frank Darabont helms a fleet of impressive performances. Tim Robbins, as Andrew Dufresne, plays the wrongly convicted man with quiet dignity. Andy's ire is internal; he doesn't rant about his situation or the corruptness of the system that has imprisoned him. His unwillingness to surrender hope wins him the admiration of some and the contempt of others, and allows the audience to identify with him that much more strongly. Ultimately, the standout actor is the venerable James Whitmore, doing his finest work in years. Whitmore's Brooks is a brilliantly realized character, and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank represents one of the film's most moving - and effective - sequences. Unfortunately, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the movie deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The too-predictable final twenty minutes move a little slowly, and writer/director Darabont exposes a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package. ""Salvation lies within,"" advises Warden Norton at one point. It is the presentation of this theme that makes The Shawshank Redemption unique. Prison movies often focus on the violence and hopelessness of a life behind bars. While this film includes those elements, it makes them peripheral. The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting and cathartic.",9.0,0,1
"Since its 1979 release, Apocalypse Now has been widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential films about the Vietnam War. Were it not for the final thirty minutes, I might agree. There's little doubt that the bulk of the movie, which features actor Martin Sheen's trek from the normality of Saigon to the backwaters of Cambodia, is compelling material. But Apocalypse Now falls apart with the arrival of Marlon Brando. Putting aside the simple fact that the ending is anticlimactic and disappointing, the picture's final half-hour is borderline-incoherent, badly written, and highlights a pair of poorly realized performances (Brando and Dennis Hopper). In 2001, director Francis Ford Coppola returned to the footage of Apocalypse Now and assembled a new cut, which he christened with the lugubrious title of Apocalypse Now Redux. Approximately 50 minutes of additional footage was inserted, 90% of which added little to or actually detracted from the plot. There are a couple of new scenes that are important, but they are overwhelmed by two lengthy exhibitions of bad acting, bare breasts, and verbal diarrhea. The original Apocalypse Now clocked in at about 2 1/2 hours - long, but not unreasonably so (although I would argue that the length of Brando's appearance should have been cut to resemble his extended cameo in Superman, which arrived in theaters a year earlier). Apocalypse Now Redux drags on for more than 3 1/3 hours; the bloated size of the director's cut is matched only by the ego of the man who assembled it and the girth of the best-known actor. The essential story, which is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, is straightforward. Coppola's goal with Apocalypse Now is twofold: to display something of the absurdity or war and to provide evidence of what it turns human beings into. In the process, the director provides a vivid understanding of why the United States lost the war. Unlike other Vietnam films, such as Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now is neither highly politicized nor especially controversial. With a notable exception (the sampan massacre), it does not dwell on American atrocities perpetrated upon the indigenous population. In fact, the Vietnamese are at best supporting characters. They show up occasionally, but the movie isn't really about them. In fact, few changes would be necessary to re-locate the story to almost any other setting with a long river surrounded by a hostile jungle. That, after all, was the premise of Conrad's book. The troubles encountered by Coppola during filming have been exhaustively documented. The shoot, originally scheduled to last about 4 1/2 months, stretched to 16 months. A typhoon temporarily halted filming and devastated the area. Martin Sheen suffered nearly-fatal health problems. Marlon Brando arrived substantially overweight and insisted that he only be filmed in shadow, where his waistline could be hidden from the camera. Drug use and adultery were rampant. Coppola nearly lost his mind. One could argue that the behind-the-scenes story is more compelling that what ended up in the movie. George Hickenlooper's 1991 film, Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, documents the shoot, using cast and crew interviews and footage shot by Coppola's wife, Eleanor, to offer a starting look inside the madness of the production. Considering the chaos of the shoot, it's no surprise that the ending of Apocalypse Now is so incoherent and fuzzily focused. The trip up the Nung River is powerful and haunting, and captures the essential insanity of war in a way that other films, including remarkable efforts like The Bridge on the River Kwai and Platoon, have been unable to do. This war isn't about winning or losing, or even surviving. It's about remaining sane.  It's about entering a world that is almost prehistoric and not losing oneself. When it comes to presenting the movie's theme, the Kurtz scenes are redundant. They merely reiterate what Coppola delineates during the boat trip. While I recommend the original theatrical cut of Apocalypse Now as it is in my top 10 films of all time, I cannot be as positive about Apocalypse Now Redux. The longer, re-edited version is a dud compared to its older sibling, killing momentum with badly-acted, wordy, dull sequences. The primary value of having Redux available is to illustrate how more can be less. Despite having 20 years of down-time for tinkering, Coppola has not been able to improve upon the product of instinct and necessity that reached screens in 1979. Apocalypse Now is one of those flawed films that contains enough masterful sequences to compel a viewer. Redux is merely a curiosity, and of interest only to those die-hards who believe this movie to be one of the greatest pictures ever to be projected in a theater.",8.0,0,1

"smooth and mediocre with a taste of teenage dream..Adventureland Adventureland is a plot driven romantic comedy about a guy saving for his college ends up on a low level job where he finds the girl of his dreams. With a tightly packed screenplay and running for around 100 minutes, the feature runs smooth and mediocre with a taste of teenage dream version that draws in most of its viewers. Its humor isn't in bulk, it is mildly funny that draws in few chuckles here and there which is better than forcibly imputing sketchy sequences that questions its integrity. The primary reason why it works on intellectual level is how it depicts the social verbal sparrings and equation among the colleagues. Addition to that, it also gets the chain of gossiping correctly, the procedure of how a news spread is projected brilliantly. It is short on technical aspects like background score, cinematography and camera work although the songs are uplifting along with fine editing especially since there are these many characters and each have their own baggage and sub-plot tracks. On performance level, there isn't much range offered to the actors to flaunt in their skills on screen and factor in effectively. Eisenberg is fast as always, with an eerie Stewart and slick Reynolds supporting them throughout the course with week investments. The narrative is sharp and mature, with gripping and smooth sequences that are piled up one by one in front of the viewers but at the end of the day it all runs on plethora of cliches. Mottola's execution is far better than its scattered script, if anything it surpasses it on a much larger margin no matter how easy and simple it could have been.

"I saw the movie yesterday. I'm not a Marvel fan but I saw the Avengers saga and the last movie was good.- Captain Marvel appears at the beginning of the film with some effects taken from a class B movie following a scene with an extremely arrogant dialogue on his part front of the other Avengers. (Come on! you did not appear in the other movies!). Then she disappears during the next 2 hours of film (I guess she went to take a haircut in that time) and she returns to destroy Thanos' ship in a ridiculous way. No one on earth is capable of destroying it? Or do something? Come on!.- The Incredible Hulk takes two whole movies without even giving a slap. It is one of the most important characters in Marvel comics and his scenes seem that they were of a film of Shrek (With a little more of intellect).- Thor... I have no words to describe how they humiliated one of the strongest Avengers. Marvel should never again print a Thor comic after this. I hope to make a team with him in a videogame or see him in a pub sometime. (Or maybe one day I find him playing bowling with Walter).- I did not finish to understand the trips in the time. More precisely in the scene that Antman returns to the present. I do not remember if it was in a previous movie or when he set up that machine. A friend told me what happened in one of the 23 MCU movies. But if to understand 1 movie I must see 23 movies something is wrong. - Excessive humor in the whole movie. It also happened in all the saga. There are moments of tension that need some seriousness in the movies but are ruined by some silly joke.- Unnecessary feminist fight- I did not like the dialogue of the final scene with Thanos saying ""I am inevitable"" and Ironman answering ""I am Iron Man"". I think it would have been better if he said ""We are The Avengers"".Throughout the saga there were moments that seemed to be watching Iron Man movies with sporadic participation of some characters.That final dialogue finished confirming that the saga should be titled as ""Iron Man and The Advengers""- I think the duration was long, maybe 2 and a half hours (or a little less) would have been enough.They missed the opportunity to give a great closing to a saga that began from minor to major.I want to congratulate the sound director and his team.

"I agree with Jonathan Romney at Screen International in that there’s a great film somewhere in The Nightingale but, unfortunately, the finished product is not great. I admire Jennifer Kent’s ambition. In order to successfully pull off an epic revenge film, you first and foremost have to have a strong screenplay, and The Nightingale’s screenplay is not strong enough. The action and dialogue could have used more imagination. If someone like the Coen Brothers had been consulted, they could have really turned the screenplay into something great. Also, at 2 hours and 16 minutes, the film is just too long. It drags majorly during the overlong middle part. The story is epic and the issues it addresses are profound but, with the weak screenplay and uninteresting action, the film never reaches great heights. Not to mention, the graphic rape and violence are quite disturbing. If a film is going to have such disturbing scenes, it had better have some strong redeeming qualities to balance out the misery of these scenes. The film takes the important issue of the oppression of poor women and natives during colonial times head-on, and the moment when the aborigine guide laments the slaying of his people and the stealing of his land is quite moving. Ultimately, however, this epic revenge story needed to be in the hands of a more capable filmmaker for it to more masterfully address the ravages of colonialism on indentured servants and native populations.",7.0,0,1

"Absolutely masterpiece, this is second Interstellar. Fusion of sci-fi and drama movies - fusion of movies like Interstellar, Moon 2112, Gravity and Mission to Mars.

After they lost a rocket it was quite clear it could not be for nothing, also no one from his team wont die either - would be very stupid to trade one for another.Second, thing I disliked most about this movie - after 2 years of isolation he meets with his colleagues like he left them a week ago. He spend 700 days in isolation, this could not pass unnoticed for his mind. Remember Mission to Mars - how the guy left on the planet reacted after he saw his fellows?

"A Sci-Fi horror film methodically shot in ways that pay homage to the genres classics, but misses both the lore and revulsion necessary to justify much appraisal.  The “fill in the blank” story route seems more ignorant and apathetic than artistic or thought provoking.  Aliens in human skin is not so revolutionary a concept that it needs much explaining (just examine any politician), but to the degree that Scarlett’s character knew English, how to drive, how to walk, possessed property, rationalized target selection, knew how to seduce, etc., I couldn’t help but wonder what backstory must exist in order for any of that to seem slightly plausible in its fictional world without simultaneously contradicting Scarlett’s jejune character.  Alternatively, the poor backstory may have been overlooked if the horror aspect of the film was stronger.  Outside of seeing a dude get his organs Criss Angel’d, red goop on a slide (artsay symbologay!!!), babies being Tarzan’d (beginning of crab people?), and perverts, for an alien horror movie this is located fairly low on the terror spectrum.  I think it is worth noting that Johanssan’s hidden camera improv was good, but her awkward attitudes manifested in a fairly unnatural or disingenuous way (awkwardly acting awkward-ception).  Also, why was nudity a thing?  Naked people still= artsy?  Seemed more like eye candy for boner grins instead of an honest illustration of on the surface beauty.  Overall, certainly not a bad movie, especially for its genre, but personally I did not find it all that great either (less is not always more).

Debris from a destroyed satellite impacts upon a small-scale mission above Earth and we then follow  in near real-time  an attempt by the survivors to return to Earth. So we spend about 90 minutes in that situation and what happens is what happens. How much of a character arc can we really expect? Other comments are like this :""Bad acting"". Utter drivel.""Sets feminism back with a female character who just panics and hyperventilates"". WTF? I think I'd panic, too. A lot. Clooney's character was calm because this wasn't his first rodeo. Bullock's Ryan was on her first trip out. She's set adrift in space without a way to take control and that caused her to panic. A lot. Seems reasonable. It had nothing to do with her gender. Nothing in this film is concerned with gender. It's absolutely ludicrous to try and make an argument that this film is diminishing feminism.

"For many years I have stood up for seeing a movie in a theatre on the big screen it is made for. I am, also, a big backer of the #MeToo movement.I have seen 9 movies so far this year and can only recommend two: ""Clemency"" and ""Just Mercy"". Both have excellent performances by the actors and though the latter tackles an often told story it is approached with an intensity that takes you into the hearts and minds of the characters while the former takes us into a world that hasn't often been explored.The other 7 have either been a waste of time or a waste of money or a waste of time and money! ""The Assistant"" is both though it is one of the latest to tackle the the #MeToo movement. I was looking forward to seeing Julia Garner as I watched her in the Netflix series ""Ozarks"" and was intrigued by her performance. In a very short time, we have learned a lot about what goes on behind the scenes in the movie and television business and how badly women are treated.Kitty Green, the director and screenwriter of ""The Assistant"" shows us that having Garner give a monotone performance with many shots just on her face thinking. They both show us quickly how low on the ladder a woman is and how she is treated or ignored by all including other women and men who have the same position she has. What is to come is shown in the early scenes as Garner cleans her boss's couch and finds an earring.The film is 81 minutes filled with a lot of unnecessary and repetitious scenes which if eliminated would have made a stronger film or allowed more time for 2 scenes, with one being passed over far too quickly, which are important to the movement.Though I can't/won't/don't recommend ""The Assistant"" I am a hopeful person and I hope the next 9 movies I see should only be seen for the first time in a theatre on the large movie screen!",2.0,1,0

"""Call Me By Your Name"" is an awards-worthy masterpiece directed by Luca Gaudagnino. So beautifully crafted in every way that it survives its near-fatal flaw. When Stanley Kubrick's Nabokov-based ""Lolita"" came out in 1962, it was advertised as the erotic adventure of a ""seductive"" teen who you too (men) would not be able to resist. Now in 2018, just as we're buttressing our  protections for children as well as adults from sexual exploitation, comes this romantic, exquisitely nuanced art, ""Call Me By Your Name"", that happens to repeat the horrible example of ""Lolita"". Seventeen year old Elio and his father's colleague, Oliver, fall in love. When Oliver leaves, both are heart-broken. Nearly every review I've read mentions ""coltish"" Elio's  intellectual maturity and emotional vulnerability. Remarkably, his cosmopolitan parents and social network are a model of insight, empathy, discretion, and support. They will help Elio turn his horrible loss into new strengths. The directing, cinematography, and acting that beautifully bring these nuances together is so effective that many viewers will suspend their boundary on man-boy sex.  In spite of our better judgement, some critics and many viewers become willing to believe a youth can seduce an adult; that the adult is not a culpable perpetrator.Technicalities of statutory rape aside, it's the developmental difference between a young Central Nervous System and a mature CNS that makes Oliver's relationship with Elio such a high risk for harm. We viewers and reviewers have a responsibility to remind the artists we rightly respect that romanticizing, even brilliantly, man-boy love contributes to sexual exploitation of anyone.  ""Lolita"" at its ending exposes the sexual exploitation of the teen as horrifically destructive. Frances McDormand says to her Priest in ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", ""...you join the club, Father, you share responsibility"". As art is how the culture talks about itself, I believe she was talking to us about ""Call Me By Your Name"".Doug Pratt, Atlanta, Georgia, USA",4.0,1,0

"Did not meet expectations but it’s entertaining. Remember the five minute intro we got to Black Panther in Civil War? Well forget that because this is the Black Panther movie we deserve. Early reactions have been the most positive for a superhero movie in years and as it stands it’s currently the most positively reviewed superhero movie of all time. How’s that for high expectations. So I must admit I’m a little disappointed, for me it has been overhyped to unrealistic expectations. Not as good as I was hoping for and still one of the better solo Marvel movies but I wasn’t blown away at any point.T’Challa aka the Black Panther aka the new King of Wakanda played by Chadwick Boseman returns home to his technologically advanced African nation that’s hidden from the rest of the world. Because the rest of the world cannot know about the vibranium and all the futuristic machines and weapons they possess because that could cause war and Wakanda are a peaceful nation who don’t want to wage war on the rest of the world even though with all their superpowered vibranium weapons they’d win easily. Anyway enter Andy Serkis and Michael B. Jordan. Also starring Lupita Nyong’o, Daniel Kaluuya, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira and Angela Bassett. The cast are absolutely perfect, my only criticism is I needed more of Andy Serkis, his manic performance was great and he seemed underused. Lupita Nyong’o and Danai Gurira give standout performances and add that extra wow factor to the action sequences. It’s got the story even though it reminded me of The Lion King / Shakespeare on more than one occasion. Even when everything else around it is a bit over powering the story-line is solid and doesn’t become an over the top mess as is the downfall of recent superhero films. It also has a great villain, with clear motives and nothing ridiculous about him. Honestly I was very concerned when the film first started because I found the opening scene to be one of the most underwhelming scenes to start a superhero movie. That aside, the rest of the film makes up for it. The action sequences are terrific and thoroughly enjoyable even if the film itself didn’t really blow me away. Maybe it came down to all the hype or maybe it was the ridiculous CGI armoured rhinos. It’s not brilliant, I liked it but more importantly you’ll be entertained. Visually stunning and the soundtrack was excellent. Black Panther is a prime example of a good stand alone superhero movie and it’s recommended for all you superhero fans out there.",5.0,1,0
" Guillermo del Toro has been able to give two sets of story lines that both mix and conjunt very well, One the cruel reality and other the beautifull yet twisted fantasy. With this it is interesting the way the director created a Fantasy movie for adults. Some scenes are very gore and I would not sugest small children to come and watch the film but you have to as well think that it is what made the movie even more special and not so americanized and not so categorised for either matured adults or young children.",9.0,0,1
"12 Angry Men illustrates the difficult process of arriving at a common consensus when 12 jurors were tasked to evaluate the innocence of an 18-year-old boy accused of first-degree murder. This movie, though stylistically simple due to the lack of scene changes, manages to provide an engaging watch by interweaving the intricacies involved in negotiations. Several techniques were reflected in the film, namely separating people from the problem, distinguishing positions and interests, and the importance of using objective criteria to invent and evaluate options.

"You got to be kidding me. You call that the best conclusion for all the marvel films since Iron Man. That was the most boring movie ever. Come on, time travel. That was the stupidest climax of this Movie. If you want to make this movie great about time travel then you got to be logical which place and time to be than other random time and place to receive something important. If they want to go timeTravel to get the stones and if Banner told them If he change something in the past won’t change the future, then why didn’t they get the stones  when Thor injury Thanos in Wakanda battle and all the characters just take the gauntlet with the stones and bring to the Future. That would have make much easier instead going to different timelines to get the stones individually and Black Widow could have been alive. The first half was so boring to do timeHeist.

"""Carol"" stars Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson in this story of two lesbian lovers and the era in which their affair takes place (mid 1950’) when such relationships were not only frowned upon but subject to severe ridicule and chastisement. Based on the novel ""The Price of Salt"" written by Patricia Highsmith and a screenplay written by Phyllis Nagy, the film was directed by Todd Haynes. The film attempts to capture the conflicts and problems arising out of a relationship totally out of sync with the morals and values of the time in which it took place and although Ms. Blanchett's and Ms. Mara's acting deserve special recognition, for this viewer, at least, sitting through the film was a slow and tedious experience..

"The credible and the incredible meet to baffling effect in this strangely confused and confusing thriller. Ambiguous plot points and unexplained story elements leave one cold and, for a short film, it sure does out stay its welcome. Even the gore and horror moments are inconsistent and the visual effects make-up looks too unconvincingly rubbery to truly shock. The fact that someone with the type of hand injury as demonstrated here could go from victim to avenging vigilante is demonstrative of just how ludicrous aspects of the story are, and that’s before we start dissecting the paint ball theory. The familiar face of Patrick Stewart further distances credibility. His part called for someone of anonymity in the role and, whilst he is perfectly acceptable, you can’t help but think that it’s Patrick Stewart from the enterprise. The film also fails to thrill as it should and only comes to life momentarily when the victims start to fight back. Even then cast members disappear with a cough and a spit, gorily, but with none of the fanfare of tension that usually prolongs such situations in the best thriller/horror movies.

"[***SPOILERs***] I'm not a prude. i liked ""the godfather."" and john carpenter's ""the thing,"" which registers pretty darn high on the gore scale, is one of my all-time favorite movies. but ""pulp fiction"" is cinematic masturbation at its most juvenile. it's one long series of self-indulgent gangland fantasies as seen through the eyes of someone who us under the impression that combining irony with violence equals brilliance. it's uncannily similar to when a young person figures out how to be sarcastic. he/she will revel in his/her newfound powers of irony at every opportunity, until it becomes a matter of sheer self-indulgence. see such film triumphs as these: a righteous african american quoting the bible as he riddles the bodies of young men with enough lead to shield superman's gonads from the motherlode of kryptonite. (oh my god, best movie of all time!!!) a sadistic inbred freak getting a taste of his own sodomy...from a righteous black man who moments before was on the receiving end of the same prescription. (never before in the history of culture have we seen such brilliance!!!!) a girl who o.d'ed getting stabbed in the heart with a giant needle filled with adrenalin, jumping up and, when asked to say something, says ""something"" in a rather nonplussed fashion--followed by a ""whoa...that's trippy"" from one of the other participants.

" Alright, I haven't seen 28 Days Later so I'm not comparing this to that.

I realize that was the point and the filmmakers did a great job with it, but I still go to movies to be entertained (even horror movies,) and this movie just didn't entertain.

"If there is a primary quality needed to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to the screen, it is vision - an attribute possessed in abundance by director Peter Jackson. In more than 100 years of motion pictures, few cinematic campaigns of this magnitude have been mounted. Not only has Jackson faced the daunting task of creating and populating an entirely new world based on Tolkien's blueprint, but he has contended with the real-word rigors of a two-year shooting schedule and an initially nervous group of purse string holders. The popular and critical success of The Fellowship of the Ring vindicated Jackson's perseverance. Nevertheless, even as the Oscar nominations came pouring in, the director was moving on. The plaudits heaped upon the first installment would lose their luster if either of the succeeding episodes, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, failed to live up to expectations. And, considering the high ground occupied by The Fellowship of the Ring, the bar would be at an astronomical altitude for the other movies. Of the three pieces of the Middle Earth puzzle, The Two Towers is the one with the biggest handicap. It is afflicted with the ""middle chapter syndrome"" - an inherent obstacle for the second episode of any trilogy. The Two Towers has no real beginning or end. (This is as true of the book as it is of the movie.) It takes situations and characters introduced in The Fellowship of the Ring and prepares them for The Return of the King. The trick is to immerse audiences ""in the moment"" and keep them from looking ahead - a daunting task, to be sure, but one that Jackson is up to. In nearly every way that counts, The Two Towers is The Fellowship of the Ring's equal. In terms of tone, pacing, character development, plot advancement, and visual splendor, there is no drop-off. More importantly, the continuity is seamless (one advantage of filming the trilogy as a single project), allowing a viewer familiar with the first movie to flow effortlessly into the second. Of course, therein lies a drawback, as well. The Two Towers cannot stand on its own. Familiarity with The Fellowship of the Ring is not just advisable, it is mandatory. Anyone attempting to watch The Two Towers without having seen (or read) the first installment is headed for confusion and disillusionment. Jackson has added dashes of mirth and romance to the film - two elements in short supply in the novel. Most of the humor, which is decidedly low-key, involves Gimli, who occasionally seems to be around as much for comic relief as anything else. For example, in the middle of the battle of Helm's Deep, he is infuriated that his number of kills can't keep pace with Legolas'. On the romantic front, Aragorn, who is promised to the elven princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), finds himself the object of attention for Theoden's niece, Eowyn (Miranda Otto). This sets up a triangle. The Two Towers starts out a little slowly, but the rousing second half, which gathers momentum like a boulder racing downhill, will leave audiences craving more when the end credits roll. Combined, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers represent one of the most engrossing and engaging six-hour segments of cinema I have ever enjoyed. If the final third of the puzzle is the equal of the first two, this will go down as one of the crowning achievements of cinema. Like its predecessor, The Two Towers is a great motion picture, and not to be missed by anyone who appreciates fantasy adventure.",8.0,0,1
"""Boyhood"" is certainly a remarkable film.  However, I do not consider it a great one.  There is no perceivable plot.  We see a very realistic portrayal of children growing up in abusive situations and the effects on them.  However, it is not a story per se.  The is no beginning, middle and end other than the gaining of independence.  There is not overt growth of character, just methods of coping.

Ultimately it is what it is and will reward fans of the previous films as well as newcomers. Just don't let misguided critics get in the way of you watching it. Acting wise there was a big void to fill with Ledgers absence but, a double helping of bad guys brilliantly portrayed by, Hardy and Hathaway definitely fill the void. The film thrills as much as the previous films and even more considering the affection the audience now has with the characters. Look people will always flout the ending, but don't let them ruin it for you the ending is perfect if a little to perfect, but it did what it needed to do and rounded up the last 2 films superbly with cheeky references to previous films.Ultimately a worthy successor to the Dark Knight and there's no higher praise than that.",9.0,0,1

"After watching Memento,i feel like Christopher Nolan wants to make very complex stories with each movie,because if Following (1999) had a maze-alike story,so does Memento,but in a very complex way. The film opens with a well-edited scene (playing in reverse) of Danny shooting at some guy that we'll know at the 5-minute mark of this movie. And from then,the movie will play like a puzzle game. We have 2 different stories:1.A Black and White calm before the Storm.In this prologue (apparently shot in Widescreen Black And White) ,we follow Danny as he's talking with an unknown contact,on his phone,about him trying to recover a man who has the same problem as Danny: Short-term memory loss. This long prologue will be the beginning to the actual movie,which will make the long black and white scene interrupt at some point.2.It's Begun,Danny.These scenes shot in colors will make the black and white prologue interrupt at some point,explaining us what happened,obviously,after the black and white prologue. Having watched them felt like watching another movie,only from the end credits to the beginning.We also see Danny's strong relation with other contacts,like Natalie,or Gary.Then,before the last minutes would pop up in high gear,the Black and White prologue turns to a colorful scene,explaining us that the black and white scene would be the actual prologue to the movie,and that's where the actual movie (cut in colorful snippets) begins..I don't know,man...But the story REALLY felt like one of those complex Math tests,where you rarely succed,but mostly fail. Maybe it was the amazing screenplay that made it feel like one of those expiriences. The acting,as always,was top notch,especially Guy Pearce as Danny,because you could have really felt that something was wrong with him. And,as i said,even the editing is well done,especially when the movie began.In the end,the excellent editing and the really complex story and screenplay makes Memento one of the most complex movies i saw in a very long time,if not also an improvement over Nolan's career as a director.",8.0,0,1

"The original trailer for this movie was wonderful. It made me want to go see this movie. If you're expecting anything warm and fuzzy or life-affirming or deeply moving... then you should pass. This 'short' is a slice of life and a very slim one at that. It's about a man who's traveling on a business trip to give a lecture and he's obviously having a miserable day/life. All the other characters in this flick have the same faces and the same exact man's voice. Through this monotonous din, he hears a unique voice - lisa. What happens next is brief and unfulfilling in my opinion and was not thrilled with the ending. As a 'psychological' statement on life for some - it's a good one, but that statement is short and we don't need it to be fleshed out into a 90 min flick.  I have no idea why NY Times et al, gave this flick such a great review. If it were live action - it would have been panned.",3.0,1,0
"""Fences"" seems confined, almost claustiphobic. It rarely branched out beyond the inside of the house and the backyard. The difference between a play and a movie is: a plays tells us what it wants us to know, while a movie shows us. The movie version of ""Fences"" didn't ""show"" enough. I wanted to see what went on at the bar with his girlfriend. I wanted to see what went on at the school, and at the hospital, and the church, and the meeting with his bosses.., and any other location that involved one of the main characters. Don't tell me what happened...SHOW ME! So, although Denzel did a decent job as an actor, (I got sick of hearing him talk; it was refreshing when the movie fell silent every now and then). And although Viola Davis tore up the screen (as usual). The movie falls short because Denzel, as a director, played it safe. This could have been a classic. Instead, I left the theatre worn out and ready to go home. 2.5 stars",6.0,0,1

"The third and final movie of the 'Paradise' trilogy which sets in the summer holiday. Just like the previous two movies this one happens to the parallel timeline but in different locations with different theme and people. The movie which unfolds the story of 'Hope' of a teen girl and her summer vacation at weight loss camp. She was left there by her aunt and before that by her mother in her aunt's house. So all the three movies were interconnected by the characters from one family. And this, the last movie of the trilogy briefs the teenagers issues especially the fat ones and their perspective. The 13 year old Melanie was sent to the weight loss camp in her summer holiday as per the agreement from her mother. As she joins the others from the camp her innocence seemed to be gone. Unexpectedly she undergoes her first love experience and expects to lose her virginity. On the other side of the story, the friends hangout and partying at late night puts further trouble to her relationship with whom she considered her boyfriend. This final episode of the trilogy portrayed from a girl's angle which definitely stands as the title promised. The director again did not hesitate to give his new and experimental approach to the problems faced by the people in the contemporary world. His bold attempt is what gave us the three spectacular movies which deals on the different contents and characters. Definitely such movies are not made to make money. But to show the people from different parts of the world about the direction of travelling new culture over the old. These movies are not for entertainment, if you are aware what you watching and what's the purpose of it then you won't be a disappoint much.

"I see people criticizing The Incredibles 2 for it's apparent “foul language” and for how “it's not suitable for smaller children.”  In the first movie we literally see a man jump from a 10+ story, city building with the intent of taking his own life,  for some reason that's better for your children than them hearing some characters using words like “damn” and “hell” in commonly used phrases; or the parents becoming so called “zombies” for a short time.Are you kidding me? That is the most absurd criticism I ever heard and really goes to show how much people are sheltering their children nowadays.I wouldn't even say this movie was “darker” than the first movie.  If you  go back and look at the fist films plot,  it's about how superheros can't do what is morally right  because of corporate heads who only care about money. This is dark in of itself. The start of this movie was almost the same as the first. Superheros who cant do their jobs get a random invitation to do superhero stuff again.  This time, instead of Mr. Incredible doing all the superhero stuff Elastigirl gets the spotlight, while Mr. Incredible is at home babysitting the kids. The villain in this film is much weaker than Syndrome from the first movie. Syndrome had a pretty okay reason for wanting to do the bad stuff he did.   Unlike the villain in this movie, who just came off very petty and pathetic.Even the new superheros who were introduced didn't not play a well enough role in the movie. We barely saw them, let alone saw their powers used in a well enough fashion for them to be considered cool superhero characters like they should be.I'd honestly say the best parts in this movie were when Mr. Incredible was trying to be the best dad he could be, by trying to fix his daughters relationship and taking care of Jack Jack.The animation, colours, and everything visually was far, far superior of course but, unfortunately that was the only thing better about this than the first. That being said, was this a bad movie? No. Was it entertaining? Yes. I'm simply comparing it to the crazy standards the first movie was able to set and I don't think this movie was original enough or innovative enough to exceed those standards.",6.0,0,1
"Credit where credit is due for David Fincher and all that were involved in this film. What essentially is a film where people sit around talking about the development of social networking side has turned out to be one of the best films of the decade. I approached the film with skepticism and doubt that this would be any more than a boring film. I even questioned David Fincher's judgement when he decided to adapt Mark Zuckerberg's journey from his dorm to CEO of the biggest social networking site in Europe. People have critiqued the decision to cast Justin Timberlake but I felt he played his part perfectly. Jesse Eisenberg impressed me too. His portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg was amazing.Overall, this is one of those films that by the end credits, you feel a little disappointed that it wasn't on for longer but 2 hours is long enough.

"[***SPOILERs***] I'm not a prude. i liked ""the godfather."" and john carpenter's ""the thing,"" which registers pretty darn high on the gore scale, is one of my all-time favorite movies. but ""pulp fiction"" is cinematic masturbation at its most juvenile. it's one long series of self-indulgent gangland fantasies as seen through the eyes of someone who us under the impression that combining irony with violence equals brilliance. it's uncannily similar to when a young person figures out how to be sarcastic. he/she will revel in his/her newfound powers of irony at every opportunity, until it becomes a matter of sheer self-indulgence. see such film triumphs as these: a righteous african american quoting the bible as he riddles the bodies of young men with enough lead to shield superman's gonads from the motherlode of kryptonite. (oh my god, best movie of all time!!!) a sadistic inbred freak getting a taste of his own sodomy...from a righteous black man who moments before was on the receiving end of the same prescription. (never before in the history of culture have we seen such brilliance!!!!) a girl who o.d'ed getting stabbed in the heart with a giant needle filled with adrenalin, jumping up and, when asked to say something, says ""something"" in a rather nonplussed fashion--followed by a ""whoa...that's trippy"" from one of the other participants. (that rawks, man! even more than when i'm watching the real beavis and butthead!!!) killers on their way to assassinate someone speaking of such banalities as a quarter pounder with cheese being called a royale du fromage in france. (did you see how the boy king managed to make his killers a thousand times more awesomely hitmenlike by juxtaposing their murderous activities with mcdonalds' cheeseburgers--brilliantly referencing an american cultural icon along the way?!!) tarantino cannot for one moment resist the compulsion to punch you in the face with his brass knuckles of irony. the violence in ""pulp fiction"" and ""natural born killers"" clearly resides in the realm of self-indulgence. he makes his characters commit outrageously violent acts with not only ironic indifference, but with shocking detachment, which of course is meant to show not just how badass they are, but to shock the viewer into a kind of slack-jawed awe. when he won an academy award for ""pulp fiction,"" he and his friend abruptly wrapped up their thoroughly inelegant acceptance comments--as it could hardly have been called a speech--with the decidedly juvenile comment, ""if you'll excuse me now, i have to go pee."" oh well. with these guys, it's either cinematic urination or cinematic masturbation.",1.0,1,0

This movie, on the other hand, had none of that, also featuring little to no original plot (most of it was taken from other Star Wars movies and a few other things), and for some reason, Rey actually felt strongest in this movie relative to other characters (and later parts don't actually fix this at all if one actually thinks about it).",1.0,1,0

" I dont like many films. They bore me. I want real stories. The art is in the story-telling not the action. A good story is not one whose content is WOW. It's one which is well told.

No fighting. No sex. Beautifully told. The French have a nack for producing films with a strong artistic bent. Beautifully shot. Dripping with philosophyical weight. This is one such movie. Every 5 minutes a new seed for thought is planted, allowed to flourish and cut down. I implore you to watch this film if you have a concentration span of more than 5 minutes. Typical of criticisms are responses like those ushered by the Time magazine reviewer where he ""began to hear a subversive voice whispering in my ear, and what it was saying was, ""Could you blink a little faster, pal?""

"This movie starts out a little slowly, and because the first few minutes are out of time sequence, starts out confusing as well.  Takes a good half hour or so and then things get wildly interesting.  The ending will amply reward you for your patience: its brilliant.  Most importantly, the characters are extraordinarily well developed by the screenplay and extraordinarily portrayed by a brilliant cast.  When Robert De Niro is a minor character, yet wonderful in his only thrilling and tense scene of perhaps 6 minutes, you can imagine how well Cooper, Bale, Adams and Lawrence are in their demanding rolls.  There are some hilarious moments and you are kept on the edge of your seat because so many endings are possible.

"When a thin line drawn between the two concepts.It is hard to describe this film. A challenging film to make as well. Not like an expensive film with huge cast and graphics. It's a simple drama, a drama that draws a line between two different theories the humans have adapted and followed in the present world. So when a film drags religious as its prime topic, most of those kind of films never received well in the past, says the history. I don't know this film met with any kind of controversy, but all I know is it brought in a wrong religion to tell the story.I'm not against such kind of concept. But this film was one of those annoying one. It's neither preaching religious nor against. That does not mean a well balanced narration. No, it's not. If you are a believer, you might think it is making some false claims. If you are a nonbeliever, that's a test for your temper. There are many scenes where it could have taken a turn like a normal clichéd film does, but it did not go those ways. Just headed randomly, dragged the runtime of the film to nearly two hours.The story follows the high school boy Venya, who recently have started to read the Bible. Living with his mother, they have never into the religious stuff. Now he thinks he found his belief, but that does not it, he begins to impact everyone, everything around him. Because of him the school loses its privileges in many sectors. Suddenly he becomes a villain to many eyes, but there's one big backing for him all the way. Then the rivalry between him and the biology teacher heats up. How far it goes and how it all ends told in the remaining parts.❝I wish he collected stamps or jerked off all the time.❞Venya's belief in the 2000 year old book reminded me a real person in my life. He almost trusts everything he reads from the books, which were printed decades ago. The science is updated every day. When a book got printed and in the meantime to reach the people, a new theories have already been proved. That's what I argue with him all the time that he's late and learnt old ones. Two millenniums ago, there was no democracy. This religious book made people to follow uniform rules around the world. Now the time is different, where these old texts do not make logic, excluding the moral values it teaches us. So, like saying, don't believe in everything you read is perfectly aplpies here.The film was adapted from a German play. The entire film shot in a month of time. Most of the cast were first time in front of the camera. There's no complaint about the filmmaking. From cinematography to acting, dialogues, direction, music, all were top class. But you know, the story had not compromised in any one particular path among the two topics it dealt with. Like it keeps poking in the viewer's eyes by not giving what they want. That makes it a one time watchable film. Because, for such storyline and its such ending, who would go back for a second view.I have waited till the final for some real twist in the tale! It did come, but totally disappointed the way it went on to conclude. But there were a few sub-topics like gay, (school) politics et cetera. Remember, it is a Russian film where the filmmakers have so many restrictions to use the contents. So I understand the way the film had been made. Even though, just an above average film in my opinion. Definitely it is not a bad film. You could like it better than me, but I'm not sure of that. At least it was unique, and what most of the modern Russian films dared to expose the social issues the nation is facing. I won't favour it, but you should not ignore it too.

Only those with no understanding of subtext could determine the film empty beyond its pointed exaggerations of American culture.

" Extraordinarily disappointing as I had built up some confidence in David Edelstein - who incredulously called this myopic misfire a ""masterpiece"" - but find myself utterly underwhelmed by this amateur-hour soap opera dresssed up as an edgy indie film. There is no doubt some craftiness to the direction and use of ensemble acting - but what a soulless cheeseball of a movie. We despise all the characters (sometimes guilting them by association) and the way the over-the-top antics of the main characters who are of so little consequence, not only to each other, but to the detriment of the viewers curiosity about - what happens next?

That movie built up Bruce Wayne and Batman as a true human being, a tragic, sad but ultimately powerful and obsessive hero, one that had resonance and depth. The Batman in this film was just another superhero, blindly and violently reacting to the Joker and nothing more. His one character moment also was forced and unnecassary (and short). Besides that, every bit of the plot was predictable and cliched, cowing to typical blockbuster formula. Lame, cutesy jokes, too fast pacing that didn't allow and time for thoughtfulness, and a teenagers idea of darkness. Some examples: How is the Joker, a self-professed, ""Agent of Chaos"" able and willing to set so many elaborate plans and schemes. Hell, how does he even accomplish all he does in the film without help? Certainly not with henchmen, whom he kills indiscriminately. The plot was also incredibly predictable. Other than a certain joke involving a pencil, I was able to see every bit of the plot from miles away. *SPOILERS* Or did anyone really expect Harvey Dent to be killed before he became Two-Face? *END SPOILERS* That's just one example.

"Wouldn’t like to sound like a party pooper, but „Planet of the Apes“ surely must be one of the most depressing of all the successful movie series of all time.I do not consider shooting (or other kind of cruelty against) animals a fulfilling entertainment, even if it happens in a movie and the animals are extra intelligent apes who can fight back.I am often too lazy to follow movie franchises after seeing the first part, because I find most of them too boring and/or heartless.Despite that, I have seen all three „Apes“ now. The experience has been kind of depressing, but also, in a way, good cinema. There’s something weird and wonderful about seeing animals acting so expressive and human.This is what good cinema is all about – making us see the world in a new way, feel something (even bad), be ready to transcend beyond the usual borders and limits that we use to make our usual life less scary and more rational.So, despite being part of a franchise and all, the first two „Apes“ movies (2011, 2014) managed to make me care, even if the quality of storytelling felt rather mediocre, especially in the part deux.I am sad I can not say the same about the third one, because „War for the Planet of the Apes“ just sucks.It’s boring, charmless sequel which has maybe 20-30 minutes worth of good stuff (mostly in the end). It does not really show war as promised in title, but there’s also lack of action altogether, or heartfelt drama.They have a lot of mediocre story instead, and take their sweet 140 minutes to get there – aiming to create epic end to trilogy.Which doesn’t even matter much because there has already been promise for future sequels. The first and second episode managed to gather 481,8 and 710 million dollars from cinemas, of course there’s gonna be more!The biggest letdown must be the aim to turn the movie more into drama than action. But it is difficult to create a convincing full length dramatic story based on animals looking sad and worn-down – although it surely works with short-form web content such as videos, articles, memes, or photo series.As a result, the core of the movie felt like a parody of similar, mostly youth adult oriented takes on dystopian society and suffering, such as „The Hunger Games“.It’s shallow, soulless and sometimes just stupid – some big things happen because they are supposed to, rather than evolving naturally from the characters and their actions.In „War“, there are exactly two characters than made me care about them, neither in the center of the story. Firstly, comic relief monkey performed by Steve Zahn. And secondly, a bad guy played by Woody Harrelson – easily the best thing in the whole movie.The character may not have been very intriguing on paper, but Harrelson’s performance makes it most memorable, adding depth and powerful presence to otherwise limp story.As years go by, Harrelson (aged 55 now) has become a bona fide screen legend, a powerhouse actor so awesome that he owns almost every scene he appears in, no matter who or what he shares it with. He is a true master, and the only thing in War“ that feels magical, not soulless rehash.I know, the star of „Apes“ should still be Andy Serkis performing as Caesar. But the character has become more and more one-dimensional over the course of the trilogy so I had trouble with caring about him at all in „War“.Caesar's become something of a storytelling device by now, needed for advancing the story but not enriching it in real way.Most of the event manage to create so little emotional impact that when the finale started, I I already struggled to remember any good parts from before.But I liked the „biblical“ ending very much.

"I saw this movie and initially liked it very much but became concerned because it overlooked some obvious problems with the narrative especially towards the end where 1) somehow the ugly man escapes, and 2) something scares her in the cabin in the woods. The more I think about it, though, these details do not matter. The viewer is given room to think for themselves and I appreciated the opportunity to fill in the gaps myself. Most of the movie provides enough information to draw general conclusions and powerful emotions. Some people will hate it because this is a sensual rather than a narrative experience. People expect stories and this is more like an out of body experience. I found it fascinating. I learned things about people, about humanity. We are good. We are lustful. We are kind. We are ugly. We are stupid. We are beautiful. We are tragic. I will give a positive rating to any movie that is unforgettable. Or a movie that can change the way I see humanity. I think the scene where she leaves the baby on the beach will stay with me forever. And the conversation she has with the ugly man and her decision to run away after his escape. These scenes were powerful, logical, and downright fascinating. I can’t stop thinking about this movie. It was disturbing to see humanity through the lens of this thing that walked among us in such a friendly city. That she was looking for lonely men made her less despicable. That she attempted to fit in for a while and try to live among us was both charming and pathetic. What happened at the end of the movie made sense, because she didn’t fit in. She was objectified by men… brought out the worst in most (but the best in others). Art is left up for interpretation, and I think this qualifies. People will either hate or love this movie. It was too over-simplified to mask its deficits with confusing b.s. … it did not attempt to hide its flaws. It was deliberately made this way, whether you liked it or not. I liked it better than most movies i have ever seen. It gave me new insights. It got under my skin.",10.0,0,1

"After watching Project Nim I felt the real study was on human nature and not the nature of the tormented chimps. The only factual interest that gave me a different opinion of chimps throughout this whole film was when the female asked Nim to share and he did. Other  than that I felt that this callous human dominated realm was repulsive and with no self reflection or compassion.(cept one man in the film) I think it shows the ugly side of man and being a person with active Hep C, I feel that I no longer want the treatment as apes should not be the slaves to our greedy selfish lives. If we want to torment and cause sufferage to life then it should only be towards our own mankind (which in fact are animals just the same ) I appreciated the honesty in the film but never felt that the humans learned anything. As long as humans feel superior and look at themselves above all other life on the planet earth I feel that no succesful progress can infiltrate this collapsing ecosystem that we face in the near future. As a rule I think knowlege should preach "" What's good for all is good for one"".

The acting is great, the imagery is bleak and creepy, and parts of the plot are somewhat interesting.

"It's oddly refreshing to see a war story where the combatants are not these seasoned, fearless, war heroes who eat grenades and kill people with throwing knives 4 miles away. This movie will not so gently remind you that war is fought by kids who are often in an army they don't want to be in, following orders they don't understand (or believe in), killing people they don't know, and dying for people who will never come face to face with the enemy. The clumsiness of the movie, and the seeming lack of direction only exemplifies the confusion of men who are not given clear orders, a clear map, or a clear objective. They are lost and confused, just like any of you would be in a situation so obscure and foreign. The director's (or producer's) choice to film this ONLY through the eyes of the men in the tank is brilliant. Watch it! And think about it.",9.0,0,1

"You are kidding me. This movie is one of the best? Odds-on favorite for best picture? Who are these professional reviewers? Ahh, yes, they are of that postmodernist breed who like nonsense disguised as cinematic art. Sorry, but this was a mess. To start you had three character narration tracks, Irving, Richie, and Sydney all had their turns--a director's shot at cutting-edge experimentation that was just stupid. Then there was the uneven smattering of Pulp Fiction-like time exploitation which just made it disjointed. The main blight was this now typical fixation with showcasing people doing stunningly insipid things then forcing us to gaze at others trying to cope in wildly emotional ways. This drives me crazy. The attempt at some penetrating authenticity with mere random and painfully distended melodrama was so contrived I just want to puke at the screen. You saw the same thing with Silver Linings Playbook and I hated that movie for the same reason. Yet I keep reading how David O. Russell is so wonderful, so I thought I'd give him another chance and see if this would be different. It wasn't. It gets a ""2"" rating because it did get tepidly interesting with the mob involvement there for a bit, as well as some of the con artist twists. Other than that, boorishly silly to the hilt",2.0,1,0

"The final film featuring the latest Batman incarnation (Christian Bale) picks up a few years after the second one. Bruce Wayne, who took the blame to protect his beloved Gotham, is living a secluded life. It takes a new villain to stir his Batspiration. Unfortunately, too many divergent plots keep him at bay and he spends too little time in his cape. There's way too much talk, much of it pretentious and philosophical. Some of the set pieces are big-budget impressive, but much of the action is mundane. Even though he looked ferocious (and over-pumped), Tom Hardy's Bane is hard to understand literally and figuratively. The only performances of any note: Anne Hathaway's sexy Catwoman and Michael Caine's teary emotional appeals. At 2:45, this film is simply too long and too chatty.",5.0,1,0

As this week came around, there really wasn't anything coming out. Rio was quite a joke and the second one seemed worse. Oculus looked like a joke of a movie and didn't interest me. So I went to see this strange movie by Wes Anderson. Wes in my eyes is a hot and cold director. I've only seen two of his movies. Royal Tennebaums (good) and Moonrise Kingdom (bad) were the only two I've seen. It did get my attention because of the RT score and I did like RT. I wasn't disappointed, as this movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. It follows the adventures of M. Gustave and his lobby boy as he is framed from murder. The very crass and vulgar movie is saved by this very weird stylish film. Everything (and I mean everything) fits together and the superstar cast doesn't disappoint. I could go on and on about this litter wonderful movie, but I could talk for hours on it. If you like Anderson, I would recommend it. If you don't then I might stay away. Though I know a lot of people who doesn't like him actually liked him. Overall 2014 is saved no matter what happens after this. If Godzilla fails and everything else just fails...it doesn't matter.

"This film has garnered a lot of attention and critical praise, and has shot Casey Affleck's stock sky-high.  There is nothing particularly ground-breaking going on here, just solid, straightforward drama about regular people in Massachusetts. I have to say thou that it is probably a tad overrated. Casey Affleck plays a handyman who is unexpectedly handed the task of being a father figure for his teenage nephew, and as the story develops, we start to see the horribly painful past that has been weighing on him and pressuring him to act out.

"Damn, Gone Girl really ropes you in and does not let go until the final bell tolls, which is very impressive for a film that is two and a half hours long. At really no point does it lag and while it is certainly very slow at times, it never becomes boring and leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat for much of it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are stellar here, as are Neil Patrick Harris and (oddly) Tyler Perry. The cast, on paper, seemed odd, but in practice, David Fincher shows why he is one of the best around and got the best out of everybody. The general feel and mood of the film is also brilliant and entirely chilling. However, beyond the whole murder mystery type deal, the most interesting part to me here was the total indictment of the media and the 24 hour news cycle, which Fincher does a great job showcasing throughout and how the media will believe just about anything and then jump to conclusions based off of what small information they may have. The twists and turns here are also very interesting and the script from Gillian Flynn is very strong. The way the story was told at times was odd, but that would be my only complaint really and it was nothing major. As a whole, this is certanly not Fincher's best work (Seven, Fight Club, and Zodiac, would be my top three from him), but it is certainly not his worst (excluding Alien 3) and is overall, a very well made, well acted thriller that will leave you wanting more. Would be surprised if Affleck and Pike are not major contenders at the Oscars.",8.0,0,1

The film digs deep emotionally into the souls of its characters and suggests that each and every one of them is deserving of these very qualities despite their sins and transgressions.

"Once again I think I fell for the hype and found myself disappointed in a movie when I actually saw it. “Moonlight” is not your ordinary movie in that it tackles the subject of a Gay, Black 9 year old kid/teenager/adult as he goes through discovering who he is. It is not a ‘Gay’ and/or ‘Black’movie meant only for a minority as it gets into the many feelings all human beings go through.Chiron (Alex Hibbart as the 9 year old, Ashton Sanders, the teenager and Trevante Rhodes as the adult) goes from being an alienated, bullied boy to a muscled drug dealer who nobody fools with and in a way has followed the path of his mentor and surrogate father, Juan (Mahershala Ali), who taught the kid how to swim and discover himself.We also meet his friend Kevin (played at the three same stages as Chiron by Jadin Piner, Jharrel Jerome and Andre Holland), his mother (Naomie Harris) and Juan’s girlfriend (Janelle Monae) who offers Chiron a place to stay whenever he needs one.Chiron, as many gay kids, of any color, becomes a loner, is beaten up by schoolmates and accepts whatever kindness he receives. It was interesting following his path and where it goes. The scene in the diner is a love story unto itself though nothing is said about love except for a record playing on the jukebox.The film failed me in that certain sections the jargon, vernacular, made it difficult for me to hear what was being said though I understood what was being done just as I didn’t quite understand the relationship between Juan and Chiron and how it became about and took the turn it did. Also a few very interesting characters just disappear from the film. I wasn’t aware the N word was used so much between Blacks as it is here at a certain level.All 3 actors playing Chiron are outstanding as is the oldest Kevin. The arch of Chiron’s life holds your interest though at times moves too slowly. Ali’s Juan is an imposing figure and the two women, Harris and Monae, especially the former are strong in their portrayals. The direction and screenplay by Barry Jenkins, based on his life, tackles a rarely told story in the movies but it is also about loneliness and trying to answer the question “Who am I?”  Some scenes are held too long, others don’t finish the thoughts being expressed. There are two powerful scenes I don’t think I will forget though they may go over the heads of others.I do recommend “Moonlight” but don’t go in with high expectations as I did and approach it as going to see a good film with a new story.",6.0,0,1

But as WatermarkShaun wrote in his/her review the message of the movie (the whole movie feels like a tale, so probably the message is the most important part) is totally wrong: you can steal, break, ruin other people lives and simply get away as a free man just because you're ""different"" (or at least part of a ""minority"").Sorry for the comparison, but it's like if a black guy (or anyway part of any minority) caught for robbery gets away free admitting the guilt but stating you persecute him just because he's black. Well, I could add things but that's actually what this movie is: a gorgeous animated artwork supported by really good music that you can't let your children watch, ever (I don't recommend for you either, but well, the animation is a piece of art).",5.0,1,0

" ""The wall around the graveyard says that 'Satin lives in hell'/Though they may love the devil, his disciples sure can't spell,"" sang Chuck Cleaver, frontman for the Cincinnati-based indie rock band The Ass Ponys on a track called ""Shoe Money"", back in 1996. The song is referenced in ""Adventureland"" when James Brennan(Jesse Eisenberg) points out the same spelling mistake left behind by some, presumably metal fans, on a wall. What makes this pro-Satan message Ass Pony-specific is the giant ass pandas that the amusement park patrons can win, theoretically, on a rigged game. It's an anachronism hidden from plain view but made manifest through semiotics, a discipline in English that the comparative literature knows a thing or two about. By aggregating the giant ass pandas and the graffiti, a denotation of synchronicity that encompasses both nostalgia and the immediacy of present time can be shown at work in this Pennsylvania amusement park circa 1987. In effect, ""Adventureland"" rewrites ""Shoe Money"" by transforming ""graveyard"" into a metaphor for the eighties, an era that's been dead for almost twenty years now. Falco has been dead for ten. Unbeknownst to James, the song that grates on him at work, will someday symbolize the loss of his youth, which would put the comparative literature major on the cusp of thirty, when the vehicle Falco was driving collided with a bus in the Dominican Republic circa 1998. ""Rock Me Amadeus"", despite lacking even a semblance of gravitas, has the same emotional impact as any number of songs that happen to coincide with one's youth. My generation, alas, had Falco and Adam Ant, not the Beatles and the Stones(wait, we had the Stones, too). ""...Amadeus, Amadeus,"" admittedly, is no ""...yeah, yeah, yeah,"" but it's the former sentiment of bacchanalia which will make Leonard yearn for Em(Kristen Stewart) in her prime, regardless if they stayed together or not.",7.0,0,1
"Absolutely brilliant. These are the sort of films that should always be made, feel good and heart warming. We start with a family torn apart but by the end, brought together by there daughter, Abigail Breslin. breslin is brilliant at emboding the feeling of childhood and how at that age we all have a dream. Alan Arkin is even better, gibing a short but memorable performance as the heroine taking grandfather, every scene he steals with his kind but foul mouthed ways. Steve Carrell gives a performance also which should hve guven him an oscar nod. But, the best part of this film is the script, not many films have a script that give a sense of realism and humour (the scenes where the family push the van our by far the best), and give a chance for all actors to shine. It is such a simplistic formula, but the writers take advantage by adding side stories and real depths to these characters so it feel like they themselves our telling the story as if we know them. The movie as a whole is superb with at the most one flaw, everything just seems to work perfectly and put all the good things you need in a film together what do you get?

"While one might expect me to be more benevolent with this film because it focus on celebrating a very important part of the Mexican culture, Coco does not appeal to that, after all it is Disney and Pixar film and quality has never been a problem with them.Although Coco's has a certain fallacy because the family of the main character, is a Mexican family rooted in the rural spectrum and these people celebrate music, the fact that Miguel's passion is forbidden it certainly does not seem entirely believable, but at least the background is believable and functional.Evidently Coco plays with the idea of ​​any children's movie where children seem to know more than adults and adults do not react well to that, after his grandmother smashes his guitar, Miguel's true odyssey begins and Coco's magic appears .The visual aspect - not the animation - is frankly rich and any Mexican or Latino living in the US will find it familiar, all the inconography and folklore are present and they are the most striking strength of this film.That it does not feel original? No, undoubtedly it does not, but the difference lies in the more entrenched quality that Pixar imposes on the film, its message is not new either and although it's fair to believe that Pixar took something already seen and improved it's also fair to give this film the chance and appreciate it for the quality it contains, not for what it did better than those who came before and at that point, like it or not, Coco is better.Maybe I am softer than I usually am but frankly Coco is what I expected, I did not want surprises or something lavish, I wanted quality, I wanted a beautiful animation and I wanted a good story and in my opinion Coco has all that.*** By the way when the movie gets released, if you're not very interested In Frozen, skip the first half hour, Disney included the long and boring short of ''Olaf's Frozen Adventure'' and that was a very annoying experience. Ironically, the rest of the audiences here in Mexico also hated it so much that it was removed. I don't think that's going to happen in the US so that's why I'm preventing you.",8.0,0,1
" I HATED the movie, and I laughed all through it. Interestingly, despite it is humorous, it is degrading. I hated it because it's low-grade humor: bodily function, bathroom humor; bigotry; shock-jock-type of appeal. It is reminiscent of Andrew Dice Clay and Howard Stern. It's cheap. We, as a society, can do much better, and we have in the past. I can appreciate the skill used in compiling the film for what it is, but the degrading status yet remains. There are higher forms of humor, more appropriate for humankind. Someone said it better than I can: ""A culture is only as great as its dreams, and its dreams are dreamed by artists. When the level of existence of the artist becomes impure, so becomes impure the art itself to the deterioration of the society.""",0.0,1,0

"It is so easy to underrate this movie as Proteus does below with his zero rating. I, too, go to 50-100 movies a year, most of which we ""screen"" through Metacritic overall scores, unless something else draws us. For example, Woman in Gold was rated orange but we love Helen Mirren and we loved that movie.  My wife is more sensitive to movies like 45 Years than I am, and there were times in the early stages of the film, I sought more ""action"".  That ultimately was naive on my part.  My wife understood the nuances, particularly of Rampling's understated performance far better than I.  I love the Platters, and when ""Smoke Gets in your Eyes"" played, I hummed along instead of carefully listening to the words.  When I got home and googled the lyrics, WOW!  The more reviews I read that night and thought about the movie (I couldn't STOP thinking about it), the more I loved it.  So, do NOT miss this movie and go to it with an open mind, watch very carefully (remember the movie Sixth Sense, and how you had to wanted to watch it again to understand how you could have missed the clues?) or you will miss much.  I think it will be challenging for younger people to get this movie.  Furthermore, if you are a little hard of hearing, you will miss some of the quiet, British dialogue.

Worse for him, in his escape he ends up killing a police officer by mistake and now they too are after him.What follows is an unstoppable hunt for his ass.The Wild Goose Lake is a vibrant but wise movie.There are certain moments in which it abuses a bit of the realism considering of how many situations the protagonist escapes from, and the violent way in which he achieves it.

The cinematography wasn't bad, but it was pretty repetitive and bland as the film progressed. The directing the pretty standard and the writing just felt mediocre. In the end the actors helped lead the story in a non destructive way, so it kept me interested.

" A lot of people seemingly aren't seeing the big picture, and that's fine. They should be applauded for seeing a subtitled film in the first place. Unfortunately, some of their reactions suggest it'll be their last.  Loved the film. Talked about it for hours afterward. Got the metaphor. Worked well. Don't believe the reviewers here who state you need to know Modern French history to understand the allergory. It works with any history. Us Australians and our Aboriginals. You Americans and your Natives. Same idea. Not identical, of course, but a whole lot of wrong done by our ancestors that's not been addressed yet, by this generation or anyone...  Two major problems with this film. 1. I didn't care about any of the characters. Big mistake. If I don't have anyone to like, then why am I watching it? I don't watch reality TV for the same reason. They're all idiots. I don't want to watch idiots. Here, the best we have is the wife, played excellently by Juilette Binoche, but mostly for her I felt pity. But that's small potatoes compared to the next point. The main point.  2.It's marketed as a mystery. And when you watch the first act, you're watching a mystery. And people, when you get into the 2nd act, it's still a mystery. However when you settle into the final third it seems the director changed his mind and went, 'Yeah, that whole mystery thing is less interesting than this big drama thing I got going on."" And thus there is zero resolution to the mystery. Now, I don't mind open ended films. Love them in fact. Mullholland Drive was amazing. Left the theatre not knowing what the hell just happened, but knew I loved it. BUT, we were given enough clues to work it out later, which I did, it took five straight hours of discussion, but I got it. Point is, you're given the clues. It's not tied up into a pretty bow, but if you're into it enough, you can figure it out. In this, you're given squat. Remember, I'm talking about the mystery of who is leaving the tapes, not the whole ""What the film is really about"" thing. (Yes, I saw the two kids talking in the final shot, very clever.) You are not given clues as to who is leaving the tapes. In the end, the tapes don't matter. Ah, the tapes were a Macguffin. They were a catalyst for the drama, not important really at all. THEN WHY IS IT A MYSTERY?! Folks, if you write a mystery, you've gotta give the audience something.  At the end of this film I felt very unsatisfied. Like I'd listened to a joke but never got told the punch-line. And if the punchline wasn't important, then it shouldn't be called a joke, rather, 'a descriptive story.'  This goes further back than films can reach. This goes back to storytelling. There are many unwritten rules that a story teller must remember when spinning a yarn. Hanke has broken two of them with this film. However, all that being said, I was AFFECTED by the film, and I love it when that happens.",7.0,0,1

" This movie is similar in structure to Traffic, as others have pointed out, but with the subject being the oil industry instead of drug smuggling. Both are well made, complicated, with many plots and characters, and look bleakly but interestingly at an ugly part of our modern world. The big difference is that I felt an emotional connection and understanding of the characters in Traffic, but never felt any engagement with the characters in Syriana at all, just bewilderment. The result is a total emotional deflation, a lack of impact. To me this was a fatal flaw in what could have been a truly great movie. Take Bob, for instance, the guy played by Clooney. With his haunted look, he was intriguing. I really wanted to know more about him and his obvious inner torment. How did he get that way? What was his past? What were his motivations and opinions? Why was he still working? But we never find out anything. He's still a mystery at the end of the movie. And what exactly was the Jeffrey Wright character investigating, and for who, and why? Was he trying to block the merger, or promote it? I could cite many more examples. In fact, I could barely keep a lot of the people apart, let alone understand them, especially all the conniving white businessmen and lobbyists. I could ""follow the plot"", but I just didn't care. It's more a documentary than a movie. In the end, I give it a 6 rating because despite its obvious flaws, its still very well made and might be a consciousness-raiser for some people.",6.0,0,1
"Batman: The Dark Knight Rises is a movie that will blow you away> This is a satisfying end to arguable the best superhero movie franchise in history.

Anne Hathaway surprised me with her great acting as Catwoman, Marion Cotillard was the memorable Miranda Tate, and Michael Caine and definitely Christian Bale have never been better in the franchise. The best new character for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, who gave a great performance. The story excelled at showing that Batman is human like us, not some Superman or Green Lantern, but a guy just like us, even if he has a bit more money. This is a great end to a great trilogy, and I think it outdoes Spider-Man and the Avengers for best superhero movie of the year.",0.0,1,0
"Drag Me to Hell: 4 out of 10: Great another movie that achieved universal critical acclaim that I did not enjoy. Oh make matters worse it is a horror film (which almost never achieves universal acclaim and which I love) and is by director Sam Raimi whom I genuinely enjoy. Drag me to Hell is all about gypsy curses. In the tradition of the superior Thinner and Buffy the Vampire Slayer our heroine Alison Lohman is a bank manager who turns down a third extension on an old gypsy’s house mortgage causing her to lose the home.. (Lohman is eyeing a promotion and her boss told her to be tough) The Gypsy in question attacks Lohman (in the films best scene) and then places a curse on her. She has three days to get rid of the curse or she will literally be dragged to hell. In those three days, the demon in question will torment Lohman, so far so good. Then the movie falls of the rails. Lohman does something so horrific and unnecessary to get rid of the curse she becomes a Black Hat extraordinaire. Now a twist like that certainly can work if the film acknowledges it, but Raimi keeps his cards too close to the vest. It quickly comes apparent that Lohman, despite acting as a younger, blonder, more innocent Kirsten Dunst, is the most evil thing in the film. The film simply does not really pull this switcheroo off or may not even realize it on some level. The main fault lies with the lead performance of Alison Lohman who seems to skip through the movie with one confused expression, another confused expression and a decent scream. Raimi knows his buttons too well and fixates on violating the chaste Loman’s mouth with flies, maggots, blood, fists, entire arms, and in the most disgusting thing ever; an old ladies mouth without her dentures. Loman cannot pull off a fun evil so instead she is more the brain-dead banal evil. This is a role that requires a Linda Ferrentino style touch. I simply do not think Loman had the chops for the role. The films tone is strange as well. Many scenes are clearly tongue in cheek (a giant anvil held by a rope for instance) but others are so horrific (The aforementioned horrible act that shall not be named) that it takes one out of the story. The rest of the cast is decent with Justin Long giving a particularly strong performance as the really nice guy with the evil girlfriend from hell. (Well going to hell... you know what I mean.) Long is best known as the Apple guy and the film keeps sticking him in front of Apple product placements handicapping his effectiveness. There is also some strangely bad CGI in the mix. While Raimi really knows how to push the gross-out buttons and the jump scares, he would have been better off with some old school effects. Overall I am beyond disappointed. Nevertheless, I guess once again I will be that guy who didn’t like the film everyone else loved. It is “Rushmore” all over again.",4.0,1,0

" This film is amazing. A relentless, brutal, gripping, psycologichally moving film. This and No Country For Old Men were two of the best films I've ever seen, the only difference in the two is that There Will Be Bloo has a distinct lead character. And this is Daniel Day Lewis' character, Daniel Plainview, a relentless and brutal oil man who cares about no one but himself and his own image. The anti-hero he plays is a interesting and complicated character, but whats most intriguing about this film is DDL's performance. If you've seen any of his other films such as My Left Foot, you'll be familiar with his work. He's absolutely amazing. However, after viewing metacritic and seeing the user reviews on NCFOM and TWBB, I realised something. These films I thought as brilliant aren't perfect. Far from it. They have one gigantic floor, and this is... Dumb people. Pathetic people who don't have the patience and brain capacity to appreciate the films magnificance and deeply moving narrative. They can't appreciate the script, the characters and there motives, the cinematography or anything. They just think, oh there hasn't been anyone slaughtered to death, or any sexy women yet, so i'm gonna give this film a zero. Think about it. It makes sense. And who are you gonna believe, film critics, who aren't dumb and can actually appreciate the film in it's entiretym or audiences who find anything other than porn stale, dull and boring. This film is a work of brilliance... Unmissable.",10.0,0,1
"I always loved The Incredibles, having originally seen it twice in theaters, something rare for me, because it met my peak of superpower fascination as a twelve-year-old. Today as a film studies undergrad, I continue to cherish how it retells classic familiar superhero tropes through a bleak commentary on legitimate discrimination at a time of nuclear threat. Second to Toy Story, it stands as my favorite Pixar motion picture. So right when Pixar announced this sequel, I knew it would become nothing more than unnecessary, lazy fan service.Turns out I guessed correctly.Now I shall go on to explain why I hated The Incredibles 2: Rather than realistic revision of classic comic book tropes, it embraces them, right down to the villain’s predictable secret identity. Unfortunately, it goes beyond mere unoriginality; more like serious inconsistency. I mean, hero work is said to remain illegal, except how did this family of supers steer clear past prison bars three months after destroying Syndrome’s Omnidroid v.10? Even more noticeable, the family’s lack of knowledge about Jack-Jack’s powers until about midway through the film contradicts the previous feature’s climax.I’ve voiced before serious disdain towards superhero flicks, but I do believe it can be done right with the right level of care. Heck, fourteen years ago; besides SpongeBob, my favorite show was Teen Titans--I even made each new episode an event by dragging my Dad into watching them all with me (since I thought he might have enjoyed it too). Those fantastical beings’ characterizations were consistent, instead of carelessly thrown around like here.Plus, it also contradicts its own message. The main villain, “Screenslaver,” says TV stops our communication, with no thanks to supers, yet here these screenwriters go freely celebrating supers on a giant screen! On a personal level, Bob lies to his wife without facing punishment, making him less sympathetic. At a deeper level, a hollow liberal “Make All Supers Legal Again” act drives the key narrative without ever addressing the real meat of the discrimination issue it attempts to talk about.You may think, “Hey! It’s written AND directed by Brad Bird… who gave us the first addition!” Well, remember Tomorrowland? Keep anticipating his eventual comeback folks. Just like that George Clooney embarrassment three years ago, miniscule originality comes out of his newest project, he rather just copies other iconic comic book movie scenes. One example: an early action sequence copies Spider-Man 2’s train stopping to far weaker results. Another example: the villain’s key weapon, mind control, has been overdone to death in other superhero plots.Okay, pop quiz: what do kids love to watch more than anything?A) Intellectually stimulating educational programs.B) A Mister Rogers documentary.C) Julia, the first autistic Muppet.The answer:D) A baby fighting a raccoon bandit.Jack-Jack’s screen time tops Dash or Violet combined, who unlike the baby go through growing pains necessary to the story. Consequently, Jack-Jack turns each sad moment suddenly funny under a surface-level Marvel mentality that hurts the entire viewing experience.Although to be fair, it’s understandable why most people love this sequel to The Incredibles. The foul script’s blame shouldn’t go on the reprising voice actors, since Holly Hunter does act well through her vocal work to match Elastigirl’s new exhilaration of feeling fifteen years younger, while Craig T. Nelson delivers a fantastic common core joke perfectly. Beyond the voices, there is some value here and there, such as Bob’s amends to become a good pop, and a memorable spectacle that pits Elastigirl against someone inside a brainwashing room, six walls blaring hypnotic swirls, her eyes closed for the whole fight. Violet also gets a fair share of great hand-to-hand combat worth her pre-established adolescent problems. Though Dash doesn’t do much other than attempt math homework, possibly to make his feeble motivations less obvious.Like the imbalance between the attention of the characters, the odd arrangement of the two subplots between the mother and father rattles both by a choppy tone, building up to a forgetful visual-driven climax. From the first act, Helen’s growth literally falls back at square one; her letting Dash and Violet help still raises her skeptic fear as if nothing happened since the first movie. It barely can even be called quality family entertainment: some dialogue says the word, “damn.” Inappropriate for a PG rating!If anything, the hopping lamp company’s gradual downfall into sequel madness only made me further appreciate their older works. We deserve better than an ingenuine nostalgia commercial. Sorry.",4.0,1,0

"Totally understand the raves for the groundbreaking technique -- filming over so many years -- but I found this film pretty depressing. One critic says it ""hold(s) up a mirror to the human condition,"" to which I can only lament that I HOPE not all boys are surrounded with adults who are pretty much screwed-up a--holes. The casting also falls short, as the children do not look at all as if they were produced by Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette. All that said, it IS really interesting to see the characters age and change, though the profundity (to me) falls short of Linklater's ""Before Sunset.""

"Disney has ruined another beautiful epic story by turning it into pile of tacky, unoriginal slop with a poorly written plot. It is hilarious that the newspapers who gave it a positive review, only did so because they were paid...shame on you guys. The original characters' integrity is ruined by being represented as old, and mentally rusty. The new characters represent the political garbage being shoved down our throats by popular culture. ( only the girl makes sense!) I know a lot of companies  think we are blind dependable sheep now, but there are still independent thinkers out there who realize a good work of art when they see it. Star wars is a classic that should NEVER be touched. With all of the money Disney makes with its shallow tv shows and movies sexualizing our youth and shorting their attention spans,  one would think they could hire a decent writer to carry on the magical vision that Lucas wrote...but our education is so poor in this country, it is hard to find someone who can speak and write proper English. For this reason, it affected the acting, it wasn't very good. As a fellow performer, if the story stinks, then the cast and the show will suffer too.The only highlights I enjoyed were the effects, the family lineage continuing with the dark and the light forces, the appropriate use of The Falcon coming back as well as some of the original characters. The huge shocker in the movie which was spilled by some jack-hole online, completely ruined the story. Anyone who values the depth that Lucus created, will see right away what utter crap this movie is. Disney must think the fans are retarded because they claimed this movie was ""for the fans"". This movie is to marketed to a less intelligent audience... We all know who...sigh...Right after viewing the movie,  my boyfriend turned to me and said, "" My childhood has been ruined"".

The cinematography and direction are as gorgeous as they were in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but the story is a complete wreck.

Nothing makes a whit of sense, the pacing is terrible, and the movie wastes Tom Hardy behind and mask and a ridiculous voice. A few energetic action sequences and Anne Hathaway's fun performance (and amazing figure in that suit) keep it from being a complete failure, but it's terribly close.

"So i've heard all the praise surrounding this film and the performances so i made sure to see it as soon as possible and i was let down. The film consists of lots of loud dramatic monologing and the fact that it comes from a play is clear. Sure the actors were fine but it was nothing particularly ground-breaking as the reviews make it out to be.Like Fences it has similar themes and the characters have similar overly dramatic monologs which it seems the people who have seen this have taken as an incredible feat of acting for some reason. However in my opinion it just seemed forced and again too stagy.I think people are rating this film on obvious tragic factors which do not involve the film itself which is a shame and quite disappointing as they should be judging the film on its merits as they would any other film but that seems to be to much to ask of people currently.Overall this film is ok, it has highly contrived dramatic speeches and the sets, costume, lighting and the general technical aspects of the film are nice.

"For all of its Damoniness, The Martian plays like a well done TV movie based on actual events. The strangely large cast makes for scant and shallow appearances for every character. I don’t even think I know Mark Watney and supposedly the premise is “The Mark Watney show—on Mars!” I didn’t read the book, but as an adaptation I am guessing this is lazy, in the sense that they didn’t bother changing anything, just compressing everything in equal measure until only the brochure remained. Damon, Chastain, and Daniels play what they have well enough to seem like real characters, Wiig and Glover are odd choices for miniscule roles written with watercooler-level humor. Spoiler Alert. On Mars and Earth there is only one joke: Mark Watney is alone on Mars. Is it not funny when I say it? Don’t worry, the movie will redeliver it 9 or 10 times, I’m sure one of those hits the mark. The events roll out exactly as you expect them, the only surprise being the soundtrack—oh wait—two jokes. There are two jokes on Mars and Earth. Damon is fine but the best scene is a deleted scene where he watches the part of Interstellar that he is in. As it turns out that part of Interstellar is better than both The Martian and Interstellar. How is that possible, you ask? The fifth dimension.",5.0,1,0

We can only assume that every OS has the same female voice. (Scarlett Johanssen) (sorry if I Spelled her name wrong.) If i remember right it does Say OS 1 when buys it so of COURSE it would be the same voice.

"Conventionally well made, well acted and rustic Italy setting evokes very strong sense of summer to its credit.

"It Follows really doesn't deserve the huge favourable critical reception and positive word-of-mouth that it's getting. It definitely gets some things right: its eerie 80s inspired soundtrack adds to the tension, and there's plenty of tension to be had in some of its scenes. It also has more brains than most witless demonic horror films of the last five-ish years, ever since the popularity of Paranormal Activity suggested to filmmakers that all you need to do is shake a camera and have something go thud before an actor in prosthetic make-up screams at the camera.However, what It Follows lacks is a decent story. Maika Monroe's competent performance doesn't disguise the lacklustre character she's been given to play, nor the unoriginal and sometimes laughable dialogue. In fact, the film's tension is diffused on several occasions by some unintentional - or perhaps just poorly constructed - comedy.It may be one of the better horror films to arrive of late, but that's hardly a challenge.",4.0,1,0
" Last year's compelling and engrossing (if overextended and overlong) documentary feature The Corporation boiled down the most common characteristics of most global corporations; then, as if the firms were human beings, subjected them to a battery of psychological tests. The result was that the typical corporation displayed a profoundly psychopathic personality--completely devoid of any sense of ethics, decency, morality or anything else that could possibly (if only slightly) get in the way of record profits and huge bottom lines. Well, if that film was the dictionary definition of a global superfirm, The Constant Gardener could very aptly serve as Figure 1-A. Fernando Meirelles' film of John leCarre's novel is an indictment of the actions of major drug concerns in testing an iffy tuberculosis medicine in Africa without consideration of moral or legal boundaries on any level; you know where the film's going early on when a character wisecracks that drug companies, even though in the business of healing, never do anything strictly out of the goodness of their hearts. The director received great acclaim (and an Oscar nomination) a couple years ago with the impressive but somewhat overrated City of God; the jigsaw-puzzle structuring, busy pictorial sense and jumpy MTV framing and editing style that distracted me rather than drawing me into the drama there is better suited for this movie's thriller material, and the distancing it provides is rather a blessing; knowing that the film involves using innocent people as guinea pigs, perhaps an approach that simmers rather than boils prevents a movie with this subject matter from being utterly unwatchable. You will, however, care very deeply about the two central adults involved in the mystery: Raph Fiennes has never been more engagingly wonky than he is in the role of the perhaps-too-diplomatic Justin, and the talented, underrated Rachel Weisz, again displaying the singular skill at completely concealing the author's secrets that she did in three 2003 films (Confidence, The Shape of Things and Runaway Jury), is wonderfully alive and sympathetic as Fiennes' radical and highly unlikely spouse. Jeffrey Caine's script adheres a little too firmly to certain well-worn thriller conventions near the end (a car chase that seems inorganic, the villain exposing his scheme to the hero in great detail), and unlike its current spiritual opposite, the compact and commercially apolitical suspenser Red Eye, this could've comfortably divested itself of about ten or fifteen minutes. But limitations and all, The Constant Gardener is still a worthy, provocative kickoff to the movies' annual Serious Season and an effective debate starter...although for me, the most thought-provoking image was a closeup near the end of a Bible being used for distinctly unscriptural ends. That shot (almost, but not quite a throwaway) and everything leading up to it, reminded me that, even though I know most Christians to be wonderful, decent, loving people, I probably will never ""get"" the Religious Right. Many of its number seem to be totally willing to write multinational corporations a legal and ethical blank check to do anything they want to do (doesn't that fall under the category of idolatry or worshipping mammon?) even if it involves murdering the opposition (isn't that what Jesus' foes tried to do to him?) And while it's well and good that they do everything possible to preserve the sanctity of life during pregnancy, the philosophy from the way that African children are regarded and treated in The Constant Gardener seems to be ""We'll protect your lives as long as you're in the womb--but once out, you're on your own, kids!""",7.0,0,1
"Impressed with Michael B.'s performance in particular; he seems very genuine in his portrayal, which is a complex one as a kid who bounced among foster homes before being taken in by a wealthy single mom.  Stallone is nothing if not authentic in his role - who better to know how Rocky would age.  Most amazingly in the production is the uncut, lengthy camera takes both in the first fight, as well as the walk from the locker-room out the ring in Liverpool.

Wondering if there is 10 minutes early in the film, left on the cutting room floor, that showed Adonis fighting in Mexico (something we only hear about).

"Your name is a movie about the phenomena of a teenage boy, Taki, and girl, Mitsuha, switching bodies and finding one another. Though this film is visibly beautiful, the concept of switching bodies is made complicated by the overabundance of body switching and lack of plot motion within some of their “switches”. The art and animation flows beautifully together. There’s plenty detail to look at in any scene. Settings feel complete and alive. If you’re looking for a film to put on as more of a screensaver, this would probably be my first recommendation.The character depth doesn’t go far beyond Taki being a stereotypical boy and Mitsuha being a stereotypical girl. I felt more intrigued in the lives of Mitsuha’s friends and family than in Mitsuha herself. All other unmentioned characters are simply forgettable with no substance. (Oh, and Ms. Okudera was okay.)The music is unfitting for many situations it’s placed in. It seemed forced into climactic scenes where music shouldn’t have thrown emotion onto the viewer and would better have been portrayed through visuals alone. It would have been possibly better if there were more orchestral pieces, but instead the soundtrack ends up being an annoyance more than a merit due to feeling shoehorned in.The conclusion didn’t feel worth the frustrating amount of build-up present throughout the film. I understand that sometimes subtlety is best for a conclusion, but there wasn’t enough of an ending to justify all that the characters have been through for the ending we got.Your Name ends up being a constant frustrating tease. While the art is astounding, the movie doesn’t feel like a complete package. At its core, it wasn’t fun to watch due to uninteresting main characters and a plot so convoluted it’s hard to comprehend what’s going on at almost any time. Instead it’s just a pretty mess.",5.0,1,0

"I enjoyed myself. The movie was competent, by today's standards, if a little tone-deaf and riddled with plot holes (albeit mostly forgivable ones). The creators appear not to have understood why the Empire was menacing in the original trilogy. It was a subtle, bureaucratic evil, teetering on the edge of total control. There's nothing subtle about the First Order. They're just evil and stupid because it's convenient for the plot. You get no sense that they are in charge, as the Empire was. They just go murder stuff until their short-term goal-of-the-day is achieved, then fly back to base and watch some more Nazi propaganda films. The film makes little effort to humanize anyone on the bad guys' team. The best we get is ""I'm not going to listen to you anymore, because I don't want to die."" I guess the dehumanization is convenient, since it would be uncomfortable for the audience to have to think about how a bunch of brainwashed children and young adults get massacred. The faceless, impenetrable, inexplicable evil of the antagonists greatly weakens the movie. I thought the new cast members were great, and I look forward to seeing them in the next ones. Their inexperience shows, but most actors need time to develop. Good things should be in store here. The script could have used a few extra days of brainstorming and focus groups before they started writing. The central McGuffin, the map, makes no sense whatsoever. You can't make a map to a person. People move. Everybody and his dog has access to a spaceship in the Star Wars universe. It's essentially a super-high-budget fan film. Good, but not great. Maybe cutting George out of the planning stage wasn't such a splendid idea after all... He seemed to have a pretty good sense of what feels Star Wars-y. You just need to keep him out of the director's chair and far, far away from the script's dialogue. Then make sure everyone on the planning team knows they are allowed, nay, encouraged, to disagree with him when he's excited about a bad idea. Bam! George Lucas gold.

" It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great. I can't remember the majority of scenes from the movie off-hand, but, in general, there were a few really interesting action scenes interspersed with a mediocre plot and ending. The movie really required one to remember a lot from the other Bourne movies (which I only saw once each, and, for both, a while ago), which caused me to vaguely follow some of the plot: OK, such and such was shot in India and fell off the bridge, bla bla bla. Paul Greengrass kicked butt as a director in United 93, but most don't have the stomach for the subject matter in that film. Oddly enough, most of America would rather watch a 6/10 movie like BU than a real piece of art like United 93. That is what is driving movies in the direction they have been going for a while now.

"This movie is not an artistic representation of the strengths of the human heart or a powerful tale of vengeance.

I have no idea why Roger Ebert loved this movie or why many critics call this one of the best movies of the 2000s. They were probably jacking off to the screams of violence or the sexual moans when giving Oldboy a review. To call it overrated, would be a fatal mistake. This film has no beauty or humanity in it what so ever.

Its been some time since i last watched this movie and even to this day i still really like the movie. I dont understand why people dont like the movie sure it may have a few plot holes and some iffy acting here and there but its nothing that serious for the most part every movie does. keanu Reeves was good but i have seen better from him and his acting wasnt as bad as people seem to think. I love Sandra Bullock and she did a great job in the movie i thought but to be honest i didnt think the movie needed the romance between Keanu and her. Jeff Daniels was great but it sucks that he dies in the movie Dennis Hopper as the villain was great because he is the kind of villain that you end up liking in the end. The action was decent but the most over the top thing was the bus jump that was just ridiculous. Overall i give it a 7.0,7.0,0,1

"While its a very well executed picture, the ideas are not novel by any means, and it only manages retreads the same lines as other European directors (such as Godard) in a much more American friendly way. The plot ""twist"" was obvious, not the content itself but its very existence, i.e., the slow discovery of ""the horror"" a-la heart of darkness at the center of the film's core concepts. In other respects, the troubling ways it romanticizes political violence could be ignored safely if they were used only as narrative action, but instead they are presented as the only feasible solution to this problem, with even the strong suggestion of the proletariat literally killing their capitalist masters. Its good that Americans are finally being introduced to Marxism in popular culture, but not in such a heavily ideologically driven way, and it would've benefited the film to be closer to Das Kapital rather than the Communist Manifesto. Magical Realism, Absurdism, and surrealism have their place, but not in this day and age, with this subject matter.",7.0,0,1

"Beauty the Beast works to an extent. Visually the appeal takes time to develop. It's a dark, deary and uninteresting first several minutes, and I wouldn't understand how that would attract children to become immersed. However past that the film starts to develop a flame, but just as it does we get a super long look as Gaston, and that's all we really learn about him. The pace keeps getting killed. He's a very one sided somewhat misunderstood neutral character that is merely guilty of not having the intelligence to understand what is really happening, and the comedic elements concerning his sidekicks fail terribly. The film tries to force ideas and concepts, but the execution often pulls away from what they are attempting to convey.However the atmosphere, songs and voice acting are some of the best Disney have to offer. I just think with the entire running time, they could have easily put more umph and actual plot devices into this, especially concerning Gaston.It's not my type of film, but I can see objectively it doesn't really have anything offensively bad. It's just not a very inventive take on this romance story.",6.0,0,1

"The French Connection is a 1971 film directed by The Exorcists ""William Friedkin."" It's a drama, crime sort of thriller that stars Gene Hackman, Roy Scheider and Fernando Rey... Roy Scheider plays Gene Hackman's partner and both are constantly watching a criminal organisation led by Charnier (Fernando Rey) whether on a street corner or in cars which kind of looks obvious and dumb at times. This film has a few drug scenes and the odd shootout but Popeye Doyle played by Hackman was much better in the sequel but overall The French Connection is not a bad film in any way other than it could of had more action and it could of been more entertaining. Some parts are borderline boring but Hackman gave a decent performance and put hard work into making The French Connection so I give it an 8 rating but the sequel is so much better however this film is still pretty decent... The French Connection (1971) contains bad language, scenes of drugs and drug use, chase scenes, small amount of action and a lower level of force and violence compared to French Connection II but rated 18 certificate due to it's adult themes.",8.0,0,1

"It was a good movie, though the quest-type plot was a little predictable.  I don't think it lived up to the hype but on the whole, it was a good starting point for this phase of the overall story started oh so long ago.  Even the feel of many of characters hearkened back to the original movie.  Despite its slight predictability, it was nice to see a few familiar secondary characters. I did have a few problems with it though -- the plot seemed a bit thin:  the search for Luke Skywalker (who is only seen in the last two minutes of the film).  The New Order was just another Nazi re-hash of the old Empire.  Even Kylo Ren -- the new ""Vader"" -- is really only a pretender 20-something with enough teen angst to make him merely unlikable rather than evil.  Even the ""unforgivable"" act he commits near the end of the film will most likely be forgiven by the third movie in this trilogy (and even though I didn't see it coming, it did make sense, especially given all the parallels to ""A New Hope""). The only big question the movie leaves unanswered (hopefully to be answered in the next film) is ""Who are Rey's parents?""  Is she Han and Lea's lost daughter?  Is she Luke's daughter?  Could she be Obi-Wan's long-lost granddaughter?  I suppose any answer will ultimately be disappointing, so maybe we're better left wondering.

"Accidentally submitted my bad review with a 10 rating. Put in a 0 to even it out. I wanted to rate a 5. And meta critic doesn't allow you to edit, delete or undo your reviews. Below was my previous review:This movie going experience once again proves my belief that happiness has a high correlation to expectations. Usually, I go into the Harry Potter movies having low expectations: they are, to me, visual companions to my favorite books. Therefore, I usually enjoy them and come out a happy camper even when I go with my girlfriend (and now my wife *gasp*) who tries to damper the viewing (she never read the books and isn't quite a fantasy fan). I never blamed her disinterest in the movies. I just choose to turn a blind eye. I am just glad that they put in the money and effort to translate all the books into blockbuster movies which is quite an undertaking if you think about it. Movies seldom, if ever, exceed the quality of their book counterparts. Even so, the early reviews here raised my expectations for this last HP movie - so much that I was giddy as a school boy up to the moments the movie started. Even the brief and unsatisfying preview of The Dark Knight rises didn't damper my mood. I went in expecting at least similar quality to what I thought has been so far the best movie adaptation in the series (Prisoner of Azkaban). That was a bad mistake. The movie tried to be a joyride of visuals and action and little attention was paid to the character developments. It was a wrap-up of sorts. One can even surmise that that was the original intention. The entire movie felt like the last 20 minutes of every new Transformers movie. Lots of action and hair-raising awkward, too-happy-to-be-true moments of closure. They might as well have ended it with a group dance a la Megamind or Happy Feet or Despicable Me. I hope they re-do this series and hire Christopher Nolan or a real director in 10 or so years. Hopefully by then, I would have washed away all my memories of all the HP movies I've seen to date. I will be re-reading the HP novels starting now and hopefully it can undo my mind/eye/ear's betrayal of the written word for the past 10 years. In sum, if you go watch it, go with a low expectation.",0.0,1,0
"The highlights of The Lost City of Z are that it is entertaining enough to keep you watching it all the way through and its characters are gripping enough to keep you watching as well. However the movie has a couple major flaws. The first of which is the directing is very mediocre  mostly due to the lighting. At many times in what seems to be an attempt to show ambient light the scenes appear yellowish which would be forgivable if it didn't happen again and again. Also the directing never is able to capture the size of the Amazon in a satisfactory way. The second major flaw of the film is it's many blatant historical inaccuracies. The film builds Colonel Percy Fawcett up as this great explorer (which he wasn't) and as a bastion of equality (which he wasn't as well). Normally I can forgive films for some historical inaccuracy so long as it ads to the flow of the film or makes for better story telling but in this case The Lost City of Z puts a man on a pedestal that never should be. He was an abject failure as an explorer that led to the deaths of far to many men that went with him. His ""city of Z"" theory wasn't based firmly in logic as the movie would imply either. To me it's a fatal flaw to make a man into a hero in a film if he was nothing close to the sort.",5.0,1,0
"The movie glosses over reality on so many occasions that it's hard to take it seriously. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons give great performances but they're both oversimplified characters. Simmons just plays a comic book villain. How no one filed a complaint against him in his time at chauffeur is beyond me. Moreover how did he get a job as the conductor of a pro band despite the fact that he's been accused of emotionally torturing a boy to the point where he committed suicide? Shouldn't Fletcher be in jail? How is he walking free. Moreover some of his actions don't even make sense. He expels a student from the band who is in tune because he didn't know whether he was off tune but doesn't even take action against the one who's out of tune, even though he's completely oblivious to that fact as well? I'm sorry is it just me or is that a contradiction. Car accidents don't seem to bother our protagonist too much. That's the least of his problems. He just couldn't afford any scars at that time so he didn't get any. ""There's no to words more harmful than Good Job""? Really? That's not dark, that's not bleak, that's just stupid and simplistic. Whiplash is a film about the pain that accompanies passion, and the blood that's shed on the road to perfection. But sadly, it doesn't execute well. The movie has some tense scenes but the overall result is contrived and unsatisfying. It has a few twists but ultimately it's the same conventional story about the tough love shared by the arrogant apprentice and the abusive master.",3.0,1,0

Worst of all, there was just no need for the goofy bet; the film was going to be fine without it.  I give a lot of credit to the actors, then, for making the whole affair watchable anyway.

Further, it's a rip off of the Lethal Weapon prototype. Unstable white guy paired with veteran black guy and they have over the top adventure. But the real insult?

"It's important to understand this is a 50 year old movie.  my only vintage memory of this is Clint Eastwood shooting black people while eating hot dogs, but I have come to respect the genre after seeing Bullitt, Point Blank, The French Connection etc.  San Francisco in the early 70s just oozes freedom and fresh air, it's on of those magical times in history.  I believe it was made with the concept of police breaking the law in order to prioritize the rights of the victims over the criminals.  An original idea at the time, interesting to think it began somewhere.  Bullitt did much of this as well, and better but not as bombastic as this, thanks to the writing of John Milius.  This was a pioneer of killing a criminal before he commits the crime.  They laugh about beating prisoners, this was a time we trusted police and didn't need 75 cops tv shows to do it.  He jokes about all the races he hates.  Creeps on women in their homes. He beats and insults a guy threatening suicide. He shoots first.  He uses illegal weapons. He breaks into homes.  He doesn't get search warrants.  He shoots unarmed people.  He doesn't read rights or allow legal counsel before questioning.  He tortures criminals.  He stalks people in off hours.  He causes car wrecks, involving kids, nearly shoots kids.  The scorpio killer is a good character, like the Joker but 40 years ahead.  The best scene is the scorpio killer paying a black guy to beat him up.  The scene with him slapping kids for not wanting to go to the ice cream factory is hilarious, it's very dysfunctional family.",9.0,0,1

"I went to see this movie because  Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman were in it and it had great reviews. I think at the time it had an 88 here on Metacritic. That is pretty much a no lose situation. Well there are always exceptions to the rules.... OK first let me say I found the acting of  Joaquin Phoenix, and Philip Seymour Hoffman to be brilliant. That being said this movie was excruciating to watch. My favorite part was the end because that signified the last of my suffering. I never cared about the story itself or the characters involved. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere or get interesting but for the most part it never did. If you want to see brilliant acting and don't care about the story then I highly recommend The Master.

"I really, really can't believe the critical acclaim for this light thing. Sure, the singing is not great, I can deal with that, but also, it just isn't fun! Snipey and dark, with low chemistry. After suffering thru the beginning, I was a little enthused by the 'pool party' scene, which was finally light, both visually and in mood. But then, it retreated into its marginally directed dirge-y-ness. The wildly over-worked planetarium romance scene looked hokey in this age of great effects... and we are led to believe that two gorgeous adults living in LA are ruminating about a kiss in a way some grade-schoolers might?

"There is a growing chorus of hosannas greeting ""The Master"" that will no doubt crescendo around Oscar time, but I would like to add my voice to the minority.  There are very few negative reviews for this movie.  Those I have seen have usually received a stream of venom from readers, who fill the comments sections with wounded outrage.  The raves, meanwhile, are telling in their own way.  Consider this quote from our own Kenneth Turan (""'The Master' mesmerizes in word and deed"", LA Times, 9/13/12): ""its interest is not in tidy narrative satisfactions but rather the excesses and extremes of human behavior, the interplay of troubled souls desperate to find their footing.""  Tidy narrative satisfactions.  Here's another: ""This is a superbly crafted film that's at times intentionally opaque, as if its creator didn't want us to see all the way into its heart of darkness.""  Anyone beginning to get a whiff of **** here?  No?  Perhaps we should take the advice of Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum: ""the movie may not even be fully comprehensible on first viewing, the bigger patterns in the narrative and the rhythms of the filmmaking revealing themselves more fully and clearly only with a return visit. Even then The Master is enigmatic."" Well, you can't have everything.  But Kenneth Turan deserves the final word: ""it's disconcerting that the relationship between (Dodd and Quell) gets murkier rather than clearer as time goes on, (but) that is perhaps the point.""  Yes, we all love being disconcerted by murky enigmas, don't we?  There's a certain feeling of sophistication that comes along with it.  But this seems to me to be more like the shared thrill of a mob mentality, the kind of thing that gets dictators elected and cult leaders established, a projected fantasy of greatness that finds affirmation in incomprehensible mediocrity.  We've seen it before.  It would be perhaps too harsh to say that ""The Master"" is an example of this.  There is no doubt a lot fine work on display in this film.  But if I want opacity, I can always just stare at a wall.",1.0,1,0
"There weren't many original ideas in this movie, other than the defected Storm Trooper.

That said, the space battles and simpler filmmaking were good.  I enjoyed the use of actual sets and animatronics rather than Lucas's classic aggressive over-use of CGI. In any case, there's paying homage, and then there's copying.  I feel this movie copied more than it paid homage.  Hopefully the next two tone it down a bit more.",5.0,1,0

"Ultimately, I felt Black Panther was just okay. It would be reviewed much higher, except it did much the same as any other superhero movie. Let's break it up into the good and the bad:The Good:Visuals and art direction were amazing. 10/10.Acting was excellent. 9/10.Homage to comics.The Bad:Plot was bland. It did nothing that hasn't been seen before. On top of that, some threads went nowhere, others could have been resolved by better communication (which is a lazy tactic used far too often in a lot of films). When things were introduced, you could immediately predict when and how they would come back later in the movie as a plot point or setpiece every time. I did appreciate the more serious tone. 4/10.Overall, I wished I was watching the characters in any other movie. The done before plot dragged the entire movie down. It's hard for a movie with great acting, likeable and diverse characters, and great visuals to feel boring, but Black Panther did. It showed enough promise to earn a sequel, and I hope it will build on the successes of this movie with a more interesting story.",6.0,0,1

When I watch a film I feel for the characters. Whether its because I hate them or love them, I become attached and care about what happens to them. In Black Swan, I never really cared what happened to the characters. The director has created abominations. Extremely talented acting, but each portrayed in such a way as you cannot become attached to them. In it's main box office rival, the Kings Speech, I was infatuated by all the characters.

"Disney's second venture into the world of animated features is unfortunately not only rocky, but also flawed with a poor act structure. Pinocchio is written to either be clever when he has to, or dumb when he has to, which then dictates where the story goes. He never has any character growth and the reward in the end thusly doesn't feel earned. Jiminy while funny and a great character overall, doesn't do anything to further the plot. He's more along for the ride than anything, despite him having been tasked with being Pinocchio's ""Conscience"". His reward in the end is also, not well earned. Several characters and plot lines go nowhere, and the overall story feels more like a verb game than anything.But this movie is not without it's good sides. It has overall excellent animation and the  movie has a thoroughly dark theme that I quite enjoyed. It might have gone overboard several times, but it never feels too dark. I would recommend it if you're interested in seeing some of Disney's roots or if you're up for a dark movie, but if not you're probably better off watching something else.

"I went into The Dark Knight Rises expecting that it would not be able to rival The Dark Knight, but hoping to be pleasantly surprised. And right off the bat (sorry for the pun) you get thrown into the movie full speed with Bane in an amazing ""heist scene"" that legitimately exceeds our introduction to Joker in Dark Knight. So far so good. As the story develops, certain things are thrown out of left field and never really get explained. Such as the knee brace that just magically appears out of nowhere. Some scenes that should have been given more time to develop weren't, but overall it didn't detract much from the movie in my opinion. As the story unfolds during the first hour, the character development of Bane was a fantastic build-up as he continued to draw me in as I yearned to find out who he was and what his motives were, and of course there was great anticipation of an epic final showdown between Batman and Bane. The writing in regards to Bane during the first hour of the film was brilliant. I couldn't have imagined that halfway through the film, I would honestly find myself thinking that Bane's character development not only was at least as good as Joker's, but possibly even better. I was absolutely hooked. After the epic build-up of the first half of the movie, I anticipated the second half of the film to wow me with what was building up to be possibly one of the most epic showdowns in recent memory. Then the first letdown, the ""Flintstone's Prison"" scenes were not only convoluted, but seemed like they were there for no reason other than to stretch out the running time. While I experienced a letdown during that point in the film, my excitement for what was sure to be a monumental ending overruled my increasing disappointment and at one point I found myself leaning in towards the IMAX screen as though if I actually sat on the edge of my seat that it would somehow get the movie back on track. I was wrong. Enter the cop versus mob showdown and probably the most anti-climactic scenes I can recall in a movie that had been building so feverishly toward what was set up to be a truly epic climax, but instead we get a plot twist with an assumingly innocent woman revealing herself to be the true mastermind behind a deviant plan to bring the people of Gotham to its-blah blah blah. This twist has been done before. It was called ""The World Is Not Enough"" and I remember it as being a very poorly constructed Bond movie with a very lame plot twist. Ok so Miranda is the bad guy and if you're a true comic buff, you already knew she was. That doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that Nolan decided to use the nearly identical plot twist structure from a Bond movie that was very much less than memorable as the vessel to reveal Miranda to the audience. Nearly unforgiveable, however nothing in this movie could be more unforgiveable than watching Selina ride in through the door on the bat bike and press a button, ending Bane's reign as one of the most memorable villains in movie history. A girl on a bike pressed a button and did what the Dark Knight couldn't do through an already two hour movie. She saved Gotham from the villainy of Bane. Unbelievable. No epic final showdown with Bane. No chance of Batman breaking his golden rule in order to beat the name of the trigger man out of Bane's dying mouth/mask. No chance of Batman being saved by Robin, excuse me Blake, at the last second. No final reveal of the inner workings of Bane's mask/prop by ripping it off of Bane's face to show the audience the true origin of Bane's pain and suffering and possibly his motives for turning Gotham into an occupied prison. No climax at all, just a used up plot twist and a girl on a bike pushing one little button. That was all it took to bring down one of the most ultimate bad guys of cinema, one press of a button. What a waste. What a waste of the entire first half of the movie building up the depth and character portrayal of Bane. What a waste of my anticipation for a truly climactic scene. What a waste of my time... After that I was so frustrated with the movie, that I had been ready to give a perfect 10 to no less, that for an instant I pondered actually getting up and walking out of the theater. I didn't, of course, but only because I had already sat through over two hours of the movie. Might as well see how it ended, which was very close to being brilliant... but that is honestly a whole different complaint. Suffice to say, by the end of the movie I had withdrawn my emotional interest in the outcome entirely. A girl on a bike ruined what could have been the greatest comic book film adaption of all time. And one little button.",5.0,1,0

" Thanks for watching my brilliant movie. What a lot of people don't know is how much work I put in, especially with my 'method' style of direction: I spent many months caged in an Auckland zoo, where I learned what it is to be a primate, and where I lost a lot of weight. When I had achieved a true monkey mentality, Universal shipped me under anaesthetic to the Kong sets, whereupon I was released under strict supervision. The actors were often unable to understand my various grunts, but I felt this created an exciting atmosphere on set, one where noone knew what they were doing. I also tended to throw the camera around when I got bored, but I think this adds to the film's dynamism. It is a shame that I accidentally urinated on the motion control rig, because it created a constant crane loop, sorry about this. Unfortunately the editing room was too small to contain my monkey vitality and we lost one editor cos I chewed on his nose and bashed on his ballsarea. This may have given the film an irregular tempo, but one I'm sure hairy animals will enjoy. On a personal note, I chose to keep the movie long to reproduce how I felt when I was caged in downtown Auckland. There were a few regrettable incidents, like when I threw Jack Black cos I mistook him for a log, but my only real regret is there hadn't been such a debilitating shortage of bananas when we wrote the script.",10.0,1,0
"For Jackson to shoot The Lord of the Rings with a local crew in New Zealand, a country at the edge of the world with little stake in its doings, is a marvel which may only be repeated by Jackson himself. Apart from the international cast, the people who were actually working to bring us the trilogy, like special effects, were Kiwis. The majority of this credit must go to Jackson for his leadership and vision, and for succeeding in hiring an able team. The Return of the King is the concluding chapter in the trilogy. The story is picked up where it was left off at the end of The Two Towers. We are shown a glimpse into Gollum's past. The rest of the fellowship reunite at Isengard. Saruman's fate is omitted from the theatrical edition, which I always found odd given his importance in the previous instalment. It is a time for festivities in Rohan in the wake of the victory at Helm's Deep. An accident shows us Sauron's plans for Minas Tirith, the legendary capital of Gondor. The fellowship breaks again in a  different way. Gandalf rides to the city to find the steward reluctant to lift even a finger for its defence. Needless to say, things work out and Rohirrim ride for Gondor's aid. Faramir, dejected by his father, rides out in a last ditched effort to reclaim Osgiliath. A family heirloom is returned to Aragorn which he uses to find help in the most unexpected places. Another plot device if you ask me. If you keep an eye out for them, they become very obvious. Jackson could have lessened its impact or omitted it entirely, making sure the battle was won through the prowess of battle commanders, which he failed to do so. As Fellowship never purported to show us a huge battle at all, and did not have to resolve it, I will forever hold it in higher regard than Return. The Two Towers resolved its battle much more satisfactorily, but Return has got much more on the former in other areas, so the second place goes to the latter. Orcs begin the attack on the city. Gandalf leads the defence. The battle looks grander than the one at Helm's Deep, the besieging armies and weapons more awe-inspiring. The special effects used to bring this conflict to life were stunning_ showing the destruction of architecture by the catapults and the loss of men and Orcs; as well as bringing to life Shelob, the giant spider. The scene of the Rohirrim cutting through the Orcs on their horses is possibly the most spectacular. Oliphaunts and Nazguls join the fight. My previous apathy for Eowyn is cured after watching the extended version, in which she develops significantly. In fact, she is the only female character in Middle Earth who is of some worth, and I like where her story took us, climaxing in a very satisfactory way in the middle of a battle, pitted against only the most important antagonists. The main trio_ Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, are absent from much of the fighting, as the other two accompany the former on his journey of self-discovery. I was earnestly hoping for them to join the fight, which they did (Legolas displaying some very impressive killer moves), but it was so ridiculously short. Four minutes. Believe me, I counted. In this regard The Two Towers was much better, as well as having more memorable scenes with the Gollum. Frodo's inevitable clash with Gollum goes full circle. Sam displays unprecedented strength of character and resolve, and the Hobbits thrive without much help from men. Men ride once more to aid Frodo in his quest to rid them of the ring, and a final battle sequence follows, after which it is destroyed. In epilogue, we learn about the fates of the Hobbits, Aragorn and Gandalf. The extended edition had some interesting scenes which enriched the characters and the story, but also some which betrayed some ineptitude at editing. One scene had a character utter the exact same dialogue to persuade someone in the span of a single conversation. Surely a rewording would have been more effective. I scoffed at a particular attempt to blossom an affair between two secondary characters. Such things should have been hinted at in the epilogue. No one is interested in that stuff when the stakes involve the end of the world. Finally, a discussion about the extraordinary tally at the Oscars. Eleven well-deserved wins out of as many nominations, in fields as diverse as art direction, costume design, make-up, sound, original score, original song, editing, visual effects, adapted screenplay, directing, and Best Picture. In the end I would observe that the extended editions of the first and second instalments, three hours twenty and three hours thirty-three minutes respectively, enhanced the tales while the third one, a crushing four hours, did not achieve anything of worth.",10.0,0,1

"I wish more horror films were as relevant and smart as Get Out. The movie feeds off a paranoia that the majority of the United States population doesn’t experience on a regular basis. Fake smiles and awkward handling of racially charged conversations are masterfully put on display in the first half of the movie. The cracks in the white facade intensify at a steady pace. Uncomfortable questions or points start popping up in the viewer's mind. What is up with the eclectic decor (explicitly called out)? Why are all the black “caretakers” acting “white” on the property? Are we, as white people, really this ignorant? In short, you start to feel an entire system is out to get our protagonist. Admittedly, an early scene explicitly sets the stage up. Mainstream horror films play it safe with the usual jump scares and gory imagery. To be sure, Get Out sports a fair amount of both elements. At some point, all too shockingly familiar racism starts to out scare the traditional horror cliches. Unfortunately, several dumb horror tropes also make an appearance. For example, you have that one horror scene where you have an odd figure chopping wood. The others tropes I could list involve spoilers. The acting is consistently top notch from all involved. I only have one minor quip with the casting choice of a peripheral character. The character certainly sticks out when you notice him and the inclusion is somewhat puzzling. Overall, the subject matter more than makes up for Get Out's very minor shortcomings. How often do movies aimed at a mainstream audience have the audacity to call out whites in America? The timing of the film’s release is sadly impeccable. Racism is alive and well in our country. America ""smiled"" when she elected Trump as POTUS. I congratulate Jordan Peele for his impressive foray into directing. The film is dense and I certainly missed a few points on my first viewing.",8.0,0,1

"Logan is probably the most violent movie I have ever seen. Extremely bloody, profane, raw and disturbing. Logan has a theme of kidnapping and child abuse, which is hard to watch because these kids are being hunted down by all. It scared me to see a family murdered one by one, and I was a bit freaked out. The script is very lazy, with many swear words inside. The good part of this movie is the acting. Hugh Jackman did a fantastic job as Logan, but the other characters' performances do not fit in as much with Hugh Jackman's style. Patrick Stewart does not do such a great job as a leading role, and it almost seems like Hugh Jackman has to be there all the time in the scene so we don't completely freak out. I understand how some people would like this movie, speaking of which that it is ""Marvel's Dark Knight."" I am not a huge fan of superhero films, nor am I a fan of dark superhero films, but this one seemed different. I'd rather see a movie where I could follow along and enjoy the plot and suspense as we go. The plot in Logan isn't that spectacular, and they use references to the X-Men comic books in the movie just to remind us that this movie was based on a deep comic strip. This is only my opinion, but I wished the violence wouldn't be so non-stop, bloody and cheesy. Not a fan of these films, and it has ruined my small liking of superhero films. I do like LEGO Batman, though!",3.0,1,0

"The Tree of Life is a triumph of brash personality & pomposity over craft, subtlety and modesty. I'm not at all against long-winded and non-linear films; one of my all time favourites is Koyaanisqatsi, a film that brilliantly brings together stunning images with fairly haunting but epic musical themes to create an overall feeling of awe. The Tree of Life is trying a similar trick but fails. Miserably. The problem is Malick's desire to imbue the film with some sort of genius insight. Moments that should be stunning instead feel forced and contrived. Rather than letting images speak for themselves, there is a constant metaphor or insight forced in your face which seems laughable. In fact, despite normally being a very restrained and concentrated viewer, myself and my friend found ourselves chuckling quietly on at least 3 occasions. I won't go into details, but the dinosaur scene is potentially the most ridiculous and conceited I have ever viewed. The genius of great directors is to carefully put together a movie that captures the minds of it's audience, whilst carefully sculpting the characters and story in order to provide a certain experience for them, whilst they are pre-occupied elsewhere. The images, though beautiful, do not deserve much attention and so you are left to analyse Malick's composition, which it leaves it horrendously exposed. I felt as embarrassed as if I had just accidentally walked in on a cheating couple. The 2 in the score above is solely for the section following the family. Brad Pitt and his co-stars act this brilliantly and the slow pace, quiet soundtrack and beautiful photography seize you completely. I became so involved in this brief section that every second afterwards was incredibly painful, and like many other reviewers below, sighed in relief every time I mistakenly thought the film had ended.This section is a fantastic interlude in an otherwise dreadful movie, perfectly summed up when Sean Penn is left kneeling on a beach towards the end.

"We never find out what happened to Cyril's mother but we do know his father doesn't want him and also sold his bike which Cyril gets back along with the foster mother he finds in a doctor's office. It only takes the first 20 minutes of this 88 minute film to find that out along with the fact that he lives in a foster home. Along with watching Cyril ride his bike at all kinds of speeds in all kinds of directions plus very intrusive bars of Beethoven we watch him become involved with all sorts of situations that in an American film would have sent ""The Kid With A Bike"" in a completely different direction than this French film goes.When Samantha, played by Cecile de France, the woman who becomes Cyril's (Thomas Doret) weekend foster mom, is asked by her boyfriend to choose between him and Cyril she chooses the latter. Cyril is befriended by Wes (Egon de Mateo) a drug dealer and thief who comes from the same foster home who seems to be leading Cyril in an additional direction besides becoming a robber.Will Samantha make everything right? Will she love, hold on to, Cyril enough to turn him away from he life Wes seems to be taking him? Will Cyril get his father back? Will get on his bike and go in the right direction? That last question isn't as crazy as it sounds because a lot is not explained in this film including who Cyril is and what he wants or needs except his father and bike.Cecile de France gives a warm performance who slowly brings the boy into a circle of love while Thomas Doret goes through the film mainly looking angry. Jeremie Renier has the small but tough role of a man who feels he has no choice but to give his son up. Egon de Mateo is scary as the drug dealer who leads Cyril astray and into a tough spot.The co-directors, and co-writers, Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne didn't seem, to me, to know what to do except give Doret more reasons not to be loved and, yet, let him be loved more and more while whenever they didn't know what to do they put him on a bike and had him ride around.

"This Italian nomination for Best Foreign Film follows a man who's just turned 65. He wrote one successful novel years ago and still spends his days moving in society's circles: dancing at wild parties, having useless conversations, viewing performance art and questioning it all.

"Downey and Favreau makes sure that these comic books does echo in the library with sharp illuminating sound.Iron ManFavreau tames an introductory animal with a smart cookie. When it comes to introduce a safe act on the play, he is the man for the job. Even take The Jungle Book, for instance, he may not have anything new to offer on the table, yet his authenticity comes with a certified and acclaimed label. The director Jon Favreau started this MCU franchise with not a bang but a promising milieu that thrives upon the character no matter how shady and dodgy the storytelling grows. Robert Downey Jr. conjuring this already-loved-by-fans comic character which drives the entire MCU for the most part of it, has an accurately bulletproof arc. Every step of his character spirals out these trains of unheard and thrilling adventures.And with baby steps in this chapter, Downey is practically always in the lead when it comes to perform on screen, not only due to the substance offered to him to factor in, but his nature of being the attention seeker in the room makes him one of the finest actor; a quality that most probably every actor should have, at least it would make more sense. Jeff Bridges filling in, the stereotypical role of a sinister millionaire casts fear on us through his poised and reserved performance, a fine example of it is when Downey and him shares a press conference and meddles into an argument with a nuanced body language.Gwyneth Paltrow gets very little to invest on along with Terrence Howard. To be fair, Favreau takes plenty of cheap shots, glorifying revelations with old school background score or even an almost weepy reunion between two friends, but there is a panache in his finesse on editing it to a pragmatic dusty ground. Besides, how often do you see, a so called hero sweat while working hard from the most privileged position, so if he goes rogue and wishes to claim his title, let's just go along with it and call him the Iron Man.",6.0,0,1
"This is a movie that is trying way too hard. While trying to be completely inclusive in talking about religion as a christian I feel that it alienates everyone. Our protagonist is instantly drawn to each new faith he comes upon, while we are given very little reason as to why he does. The acting during the book ends of this movie is pretty poor, and the script is sub par. The middle third of the movie is the strong point, and also where the movie excels visually. I was impressed with the way that they built Pi and Richard Parker's relationship. I expected Pi to be cuddling with his tiger moments after being stranded alone on the boat with him. Instead there are many moments of dread and even after one moment where he can touch Richard Parker he still respects him as a wild animal at the end of their journey. The second bookend has as many problems as the first, and the emotional punch that they are trying to achieve at the final reveal is neither earned or evokes much emotion.

"Writer/Director Paul Schrader was raised by parents who were strict Calvinists (a form of Protestant Christianity that heavily emphasizes the belief that people are predestined to a life of sin because of their universally corrupt natures).  His upbringing heavily influenced Schrader’s screenwriting, which gravitates toward themes like sin and salvation.  After bursting onto the scene as the screenwriter for Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” (1976) and following up by writing 1980’s “Raging Bull,” Schrader got behind the camera and began to explore the dark side of human nature in earnest.  His previous film “First Reformed” (2017) is the character study of a minister grappling with internal personal despair as well as an existential angst brought on by the climate crisis.In “The Card Counter,” Schrader again takes a deep dive into the concepts of revenge, redemption and self-loathing.  William Tell (based on the fable? a reference to a tic/mannerism that causes a poker player’s undoing?) is a professional gambler tortured by his role as an interrogator at Abu Ghraib.  He tries to keep other humans and his own past at arm’s length by traveling to mid-sized cities to participate in lower-level poker tournaments.  Playing cards is the mechanism for keeping himself at bay.  Keeping his expectations low is his defense mechanism against hope.  An award-worthy Oscar Isaac (see what I did there?) is simply spectacular in the role. Along the way, Tell meets La Linda (Tiffany Haddish, playing it straight) who offers him financial backing and, perhaps, more.  He befriends Cirt (Tye Sheridan), the bitter son of a fellow interrogator at Abu Ghraib who eventually committed suicide.  Tell decides to change his modest career plans to redeem Cirt from his destructive focus on revenge.Along the way, Schrader uses this story line to speculate about some very big questions:  Is interaction with other people truly worthwhile and rewarding?  Is the American adventurism of the early 2000s, represented by Abu Ghraib, an indication of a nation rotting from the inside?  Is the main constraint on humans the self-limiting choices they make, made worse by their lack of imagination?Because this is a Schrader film, there are a few predictable elements.  As in “Taxi Driver” and “First Reformed,” the protagonist/anti-hero is a diarist, using his writing to describe an internal agony that he cannot vocalize to another human being.  This weightiness is offset, occasionally, by some absurdist comic relief.  In several scenes, a Ukrainian poker player, decked out in red, white and blue for no apparent reason, is serenaded by loyal fans who chant “U.S.A., U.S.A.” whenever he wins a key hand.It’s hard to evaluate whether to recommend this film for regular moviegoers.  Critics, steeped in the work of Robert Bresson, transcendentalist filmmaking and French New Wave cinema will adore it.  For us regular folks, the film’s unflinching examination of its characters, particularly Tell, offer their own rewards.  But be forewarned, this film requires moviegoers to fill in some narrative blanks and interpret their own meanings at key points.

"SFReader.com review of Ex Machina Movies about Artificial Intelligence have been around a while. I'm not sure what the first one was, but in 1968, 2001: A Space Odyssey introduced HAL. The first movie that made an impression with me was WarGames in 1983. Then you've got the Terminator franchise, A.I., I, Robot, The Matrix, Her, and a whole host of others. Most of these films have an already developed A.I. as the adversary with humans struggling to resist extinction at the hands of the machine intelligence. The genesis of that intelligence, for the most part, has already taken place, and now we're dealing with the aftermath. I can't recall any movie that actually looks at deciding whether or not the machine intelligence is actually intelligent and free thinking. An that's what Ex Machina does. We're introduced to a machine intelligence, but is it really A.I.? Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer who works for Bluebook, the film's version of Google and the most widely used search engine in the world. He ""wins"" a company-wide contest, the prize being getting to spend a week with the company's reclusive genius CEO Nathan (Oscar Isaac) at Nathan's isolated mountain home, which is also a research facility. It's a working vacation, however, and upon arrival, Nathan presents Caleb with a task -- perform Turing testing on an artificial intelligence he developed to determine if it's true A.I. and if it's self-aware. Thus we meet Ava, the humanoid robot built by Nathan that houses the A.I. If you aren't in the know, the Turing test is when a tester interrogates the A.I. to judge, from its responses, whether or not it is human. In a true Turing test, the human doesn't see the A.I. and thus doesn't know if he or she is talking to a person or a machine. Here, Caleb already knows he's talking to a machine; knowing such, will he come to see Ava as intelligent and free thinker? Her own ""person"" despite her origins? Thus starts a cat-and-mouse game, with Caleb asking questions of Ava, while at he same time Ava asks questions of him. Over all this is Nathan, who seems to be manipulating them both. But who is manipulating whom? Does Ava have her own goals and agenda? Does she feel? Is she self-aware? Does she think? What is thinking beyond a reaction to external stimulus? Yes, she a robot, she's ""programmed"" but how is that any different than our own organic ""programming""? The astute example provided here is sexual preference. Are you primarily heterosexual or homosexual? Did you decide to be that way, or were you programmed? Maybe the truest indicator of a self-aware intelligence is a desire for survival. Or maybe the ability to deceive. Perhaps it's convincing others to do things that serve its own purposes. To do so requires not only an awareness of your own desires, but also the desires of another person, and the facility to falsely give them what they want with the ultimate goal being to get what YOU want. Right now, I think only humans are operating at this level. Ex Machina is solid entertainment that asks some pertinent questions about the nature of intelligence, emotion and motivation. It's got some robot boobies in it, and some violence, but nothing too extreme, making it suitable for around 15 and over despite its R rating. One thing that jumped out at me was Nathan's justification for creating Bluebook. Most people, Nathan says, think Bluebook exists to give them information, but what it's really doing is collecting information about them. So think about that the next time you use Google.",8.0,0,1

"This was my first Tarantino movie and it was a pretty bad first impression, but we will get to that.First for what I liked: Rick Dalton. Rick is a very charming and entertaining character. He is the only character in the movie that goes thought a satisfactory character arc and who affects the story with his actions, he has a lot of touching and funny moments, seeing him evolve filled me with joy and pride. Most of the other characters have their moments but he is in my opinion the one who shines the brightest.This movie is full of art and charm, there's a lot of funny scenes that seem pretty genuine. It has a very unique storytelling and an artistic portrayal of life. If it was for the characterization, soundtrack and art direction alone this would be an excellent movie, but that's not all that movies are for me.This leads us to the things I didn't enjoy: mainly the plot and character progression. I found the plot difficult to follow, and it feels like it goes nowhere. Most characters are static and have 0 reason to be there. They take long chunks of the movie to present them to you for them to do absolutely nothing of importance. A lot of scenes are meaningless and are not even entertaining, they seem to serve no purpose. Even for some of the protagonists, it feels like none of their actions has any weight in the story. This ends up meaning we have a long, long movie where roughly 50% of it is enjoyable. It truly drags for way too long (it didn't need to be a 2 hours and a half) and most plot threads have no satisfying conclusions.Then theres the violence: Despite this being my first Tarantino movie I knew he was famous for his bloody fight scenes, so I was looking foward to that, and the scenes are there, but when the film gets to finally be violent, it feels nonsensical, brutal and unearned. Theres a fight scene at the end that I think was supposed to be ""cool"" and funny since my friend and the rest of the cinema were laughing pretty hard, but for me it was weirdly disgusting, and not visually but conceptually. They seemed like violence for the sake of it, nothing to justify it, nothing in line, nothing to enjoy.I guess I was supposed to like the other protagonist, Cliff Booth, and think he was cool, but the most we get to know about him the most I disliked him. He goes from a pretty funny, loving guy to a violent smug **** then we learn that's what he always was. When he got into fights I catched myself always rooting for the other side to win, and I don't believe those were Tarantino's intentions.In conclusion, my guess is that this movie is for Tarantino fans, those people who already consider him a genious and a visionary and therefore can analize every little scene looking for hidden meaning and symbolism. For me it was a way too long movie that was only half entertaining, with half of the scenes being meaningful, half of the characters serving any purpose and half of the protagonists being likeable at all.And also, it should have been half as long.",5.0,1,0

"""Calvary"" stars Brendan Gleeson and Chris O’Dowd in this strange film both written and directed by John Michael McDonagh, At the outset let me say that I am a huge Brendan Gleeson fan and appreciate and respect almost everything in which I’ve ever seen him perform. He did not disappoint me in this film but, like watching a race car unable to go more than 15 mph, Mr. Gleeson’s character is locked into a script that is lacking in both credibility and common sense. Also, either cut from the original film or the result of just poor writing , or both, there are many unexplained scene and location changes that befuddle the viewer as well as pose unanswered questions regarding significant events that take place in the movie. Throughout the film the viewer is put into a dry, slow and melancholy mood as one searches for the good film that is somewhere within the one that was actually released. I give the film  a 7  with both kudos and regrets to Mr. Gleeson for becoming enmeshed in this project.",7.0,0,1

"If you’re looking for a movie that has laughs for adults and a spook for younger viewers Coraline is the movie for you. In 2009 the movie Coraline was made by Laika Entertainment. I just watched the movie for a school project. The movie Coraline is based off a book made by Neil Gaiman. Coraline the main character is played by Dakota Fanning. The main character in this movie is Coraline and the supporting characters are Wybie (Wyborn), Bobinsky, Coraline’s other and real mother and father, the cat, and the 2 woman that live in the basement. Coraline, a girl from Michigan, has made the move to the Pink Palace Apartments in Oregon for her parent’s job. While the Jones family believed their life would continue to be bland and routine, Coraline opens the door to secrets and a whole lot of problems.  While Coraline wonders the house counting squeaky doors, leaky windows, and odd paintings she finds a locked, knee high door in the family room. Making a deal with her mom she unlocks the door, to find bricks and the door blocked off. With help from mice she’s welcomed into the alternate world with open arms from her other mother and father. The first visit Coraline realized that while everything was the same, one main difference stood out, the buttons on the eyes of her alternate parents. Coraline, continues to visit the alternate world but begins to get a more eerie vibe with each visit. With Coraline’s other mother trying to love her forever, will Coraline give into the other world’s temptations? Some of the things we liked was the stop motion filming and unique story line. The other mother was a very strong character and the movie centered around her and the world she created. I feel like Wybie was a key character in the movie but never fully developed. I also believe that while the main focus was on Coraline’s other parents, there was not enough screen time of her real parents to get a full feel for Coraline’s home life. The characters were played very well by the actors behind them, and helped really tie the movie together. While there were many positives, I believe the movie was inappropriate for the age group it is advertised in. With scandalous content in the scene with Forcible and Spink’s performance in the alternate world and an alarming plot with characters who change for the worst the movie is not as family friendly as it is portrayed.   I would recommend this movie to people who are into an eerie vibe. Parents may want to view the movie before their children.With the possibility of nightmares from characters who change to be creepy and scenes that include jump scares I don’t recommend this for anyone younger than 7. The MPAA rating of this movie is PG, and despite its rating I would recommend it for ages 8 and up. Rating out of 5 stars:3 Stars ***",3.0,1,0

"The Force Awakens is a COMPLETE disaster as a film. How anyone can even pretend it's good genuinely baffles me. Here's the short version of why this film sucks: 1) Leia is not a Jedi. Really? Does it make sense that a force-sensitive person would walk away from the power to be a Jedi? Especially when she saw 1st hand how dark Jedis can almost take over the galaxy. Does it make sense that she'd let Luke teach all the Jedi alone? No. I get we dont want to see a cgi Carrie Fisher with a lightsaber, but story-wise, it makes no sense. 2) Luke Skywalker is a running coward. Seriously? Kylo Ren made the last Jedi run away and hide? Kylo doesn't seem that bad ass to me, but whatever, he made Luke hide for an entire film... 3) Kylo Ren is a **** Like a GIANT **** This Skywalker trained dark Jedi can barely take out stormtroopers (Finn) and gets his ass kicked by someone who has NEVER once held an ignited lightsaber before the moment of the duel? LOL 4) Finn is Jar Jar Binks. I went into this film wanting to like Finn the best. Why? Cause he's on the poster holding Luke's Lightsaber. That leads you to believe that he's a Jedi. They've never before shown someone on a Star Wars poster with a lightsaber who wasn't a Jedi. Until now. Had they put Rey on the poster holding the lightsaber, I'd have no problem with Finn losing EVERYTIME he touches the thing. But as it stands, they did put Finn on that poster holding the lightsaber and ALL he ever did with that lightsaber was get his ass kicked with it. One of his losses was to an un-named character... LOL 5) Rey is god. I don't mind my make believe tales of fantasy having a female lead. I do however mind when that female lead is vastly overpowered without trying. Rey is more powerful than Luke was in Empire Strikes Back. With ZERO training. She can fly as good as Han/Lando with no experience flying the Falcon, she's as strong as Luke, and she can even translate every language like C3P0. I love that we have a female lead. I hate that she is a Mary Sue. 6) Han Solo's death held no emotion. I went into this film with no spoilers, but I saw Han Solo's death coming from an hour and a half away. Then when the actual scene is setup, its insanely obvious what's about to happen. They may as well have had a neon sign in the background that read: ""Han solo dies in this scene! don't go for popcorn!"" This is the kind of thing that pulls people out of movies. Then the actual death happened and I was like, ""meh"". The problem with me seeing the death coming from so far away is, I'll see the death in my head 1st. And it was cooler in my head. 7) Chewie and Leia walk past each other after Han dies. This is a film breaking error on the part of JJ (Jar Jar) Abrams. It makes absolutely ZERO sense that 2 old friends and comrades would simply walk right past each other after the death of someone so important to both of them. They walked past each other without SO MUCH AS A GLANCE BETWEEN THEM. If they aren't ready to talk or if Leia wants to talk to Rey, fine, but you have to show SOMETHING. A simple nod. Anything. As it stands, these 2 characters are broken until its explained why they behaved as if they'd never met before. It's Star Wars. I get the need to want to love this. And it's also trailblazing for girls and women everywhere and that's a great thing. I get why it's hard to say its a bad movie when you want to like it so bad. But this is a JJ Abrams film. And it's a very bad film. And as a die hard Star Wars fan it causes me physical pain to admit that.",0.0,1,0

"The CIA trained and funded Bin Laden as part of their effort to create militant Islamic ideology to combat the Soviet Union and Marxism back in the 70s and 80s. This agency gleefully provided torture coaching and assistance to Pinochet and the Argentinian Junta. It concocted false evidence and testimonies in the run up to both of the Gulf wars, and has been further destroying America's reputation worldwide for over a decade by torturing and murdering its way through the Middle East. And now it has somehow been allowed to make an undisputed, seemingly authoritative account of history in a way that both serves as PR for the CIA, but also makes a serious case to absolve the agency of its crimes by pointing to their utilitarian necessity. Imagine a film about a serial killer, who in the early stages of his life, and indeed throughout his initial murders is trained, and assisted both in tactics and funding by the cops, the good guys who spend the rest of the film chasing the killer and finally capturing him. It would make you feel conflicted, and would raise questions about who the 'good' guys are, and just how 'good' they happen to be. Now consider how Zero Dark Thirty avoids the difficult task of confronting the reality. It relies on ostentatious badassery aimed at teenage boys who think the word  must be met with obligatory laughter. It strives to induce war-nerd boners among cargo-pant wearing gamers. And it reduces a contentious moment in U.S.history, the true events of which is kept under lock and key by an agency apparently incapable of acting morally or even legally, to your common or garden variety of detective fiction.",0.0,1,0
"Always been a fan of a good scifi movie... I was like 6 when this came out and didn't watch it back then and for some reason never got around to watching it until recently. I've been told numerous times this was a classic, one of the best of the genre. Well wait, I did watch it like 10 years ago after a friend told me it was his favorite movie of all times and I honestly don't remember any of it, other than I felt it was pretty boring. So a couple months ago I watched it and fell asleep on it... and now I finally got around to watching it fully, well rested and with no expectations.I just feel the jell-o doesn't take hold... It seems like the whole plot is very shallow and uneventful. Throughout the movie, you don't quite get what the runaway replicants want exactly and by the time you do, they pretty much learn they can't do anything about it... Then it just becomes a succession of extremely cheesy action scenes (the whole JF Sebastian apartment ending, geez man, give me a break).Overall, it was a pretty excruciating experience to watch.

"This heartbreaking indictment of the downsides of gentrification evokes a decidedly powerful emotional response, but its disjointed storytelling approach leaves viewers wanting for greater clarity. When an aspiring Black screenwriter returns to the Washington, DC neighborhood where he grew up to pen a script about his upbringing, he's overwhelmed by the many changes that have taken place since he left and moved to California, most notably the pronounced shift in local demographics and the scattering of his childhood friends. Memories of his past flood back as he attempts to process the situation, an experience that incites an incendiary slowburn. While director Merawi Gerima's attempt at putting an artistic spin on this story is noteworthy, the approach doesn't work much of the time, leaving audiences scratching their heads trying to figure out exactly what is going on. The mix of present-day action and flashbacks becomes so cumbersomely jumbled at times that it's easy to lose sight of -- and interest in -- what's transpiring on the screen. A number of story threads remain woefully underdeveloped as a consequence, despite the elegant cinematography employed to depict portions of them. This offering would have been far more impactful if a more straightforward narrative approach were employed, something this debut filmmaker may want to consider for future projects.",5.0,1,0

"The final installment in Christopher Nolan's trilogy of Batman movies has a lot of things going for it. The usage of practical effects, the entertaining performances from Anne Hathaway and Tom Hardy, and the sometimes brilliant action sequences (particularly in the film's opening) can be exhilarating. However, the whole affair feels like a cobbled together mess with a script that never feels like it progressed beyond its first initial rough draft. The sound mixing is extremely wonky, the pacing is all over the place, and the story has way too many plot holes for the supposedly ""realistic"" world that Nolan is presenting.

"It's like watching a very average - but very high budget - Star Wars fan film, from somebody who didn't really understand the original saga, or even how to direct a well-paced movie. Usually when it comes to reviewing sequels of old fan-favourite films, I find myself hampered somewhat by nostalgia; my love for the originals expands my expectations to the point that they become unrealistic. But not so here. With The Force Awakens, I found my nostalgia satisfied (due to the exorbitant and constant fan pandering), but I attempted to appraise from the perspective of somebody who had never seen the originals. What I saw was a film which barely measured up to the typical cliched tripe Hollywood superhero movie that is churned out on a tri-annual basis. Some of the acting is good, the scenes are pretty, and there are some fairly emotional moments in the film, but that's literally all the good things I have to say about it. It is rushed, jumping from poorly-considered action scene to action scene, without really stopping to build any real character relationships, nor pause to authenticate the fictional universe and its massive mythos. The rest of the acting is fairly hard to swallow, particularly from the 'bad guys' and the typical fanfare of Lost / Heroes cast which J.J Abrams parades in just about every project he gets his mitts on, but also some of the time the acting from Rey felt overdone and patronising. Indeed, patronising would be a word I would use to describe the entire movie. From the plot which seems to throw all of the prior work out of the window, to the spoon-fed 'wow he's a great pilot!' exposition, to the cliched gags. The entire showing bares the unsightly brand of J.J.Abrams' hubris, as he dances on the premature grave of George Lucas, declaring the the world that he knows better; that his vision of Star Wars is superior. Spoiler alert: it's not. It's a fun movie, but that's it. And when the hype of the big screen dies down, people will remember this as what it was: an average cash-in without any real heart or soul.",5.0,1,0

"The idea behind this film was a fantastic one. It sought to do what no previous film had ever attempted, that being filming the actors over several years as they grew rather than trying to cast others who looked similar at various ages. That in and of itself is a remarkable feat. However, like many films that try to accurately emulate what real life is like, this story didn't have much of a plot. It is understandably difficult to have an overarching theme when trying portray the life and struggles of an adolescent boy. That is perhaps why this particular film seemed to wander significantly. There were a couple of really good scenes and a few powerful lessons that one could take away from this motion picture, but simply good scenes, unfortunately, do not make a good movie.",6.0,0,1

"No matter how bizarre or polarizing a film from them looks at first glance, A24's name being attached to a film is usually all the incentive I need to check it out, as I've always highly admired their keen eye for unique and/or bizarre premises and stories from the films that they (usually) wisely choose to distribute. That was certainly the case for this film prior to me seeing it, as I was highly intrigued by its simple yet universal premise of life, love, loss, etc. Unfortunately, the best way for me to sum this film up is 'huge potential wasted.' The film felt incredibly disjointed, jumping from so many random points and events in time. In addition, Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara's talents felt rather wasted to me, as they literally don't speak for well over half the film (seriously, I'm pretty sure a little over half the film contained no dialogue, as the entire middle act of the film is borderline silent). To top it all off, the film felt to me as though it really had no clear sense of direction or what it wanted to convey at certain times or how to convey certain things. So many scenes felt as though they were there just for filler purposes. An excellent case in point: We get to watch a depressed and grieving Rooney Mara eat a whole pie in her kitchen for about 5+ minutes. Overall, some of the film's ideas and symbolic purposes pertaining to its subject matter were somewhat interesting, and it had some decent imagery as well, but the rest of this film felt very void-like, much like the film's subject matter, which was certainly what I wasn't hoping for.",5.0,1,0

"From the very start, you can see that Catching Fire is a much bigger production than The Hunger Games. It's a good thing the movie elaborates more on the relationship between Katniss and Prim, because we finally get to see some real feeling behind Katniss' motive, which is a thing that the book lacked. Secondly, I also like how the movie elaborates on the precarious situation the president Snow is in, and how he copes with it. The movie does succeed in portraying an exotic lethal and especially dynamic arena, featuring great special effects, decors and non-stop action. The acting is good overall, although the two TV-commentators are amazingly flat characters, firing off meaningless and dull one-liners and acting ostentatiously. These are not the characters that Collins creates in the book that I criticize however, but the actual clumsiness by which the movie handles them. Actually every public appearance or speech of any kind is very empty of meaning and substance. In a repressive system where twelve districts are controlled (against their will) by a totalitarian regime, the power of propaganda should extend beyond the TV-set. What I mean is that not only the repetition of visual display of power is enough to sketch a believable world. The power of rhetoric is nowhere to be seen, which is a shame. The movie does in certain ways improve over the book (ie. providing different points of focalization) and it does a great job in compacting the book into a consistent two hour movie.",8.0,0,1
" Incredibly over-rated. This is a silly movie. About two-thirds of the way through the film the plot is forgotten - and major aspects remain unexplained and unresolved - in favour of a love-story.

"""They sure don't make 'em like this in Hollywood.""  That was my thought after I had calmly settled into the film, only to be jolted awake at the sight of what could be the most graphic rape/sexual violence scene I've witnessed in major cinema. It wasn't enough to make my stomach turn, but my female companion certainly wasn't too comfortable with what was going on. Later in the film, I got my own taste of that feeling. Because if The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo offers anything, sexual/graphic violence are at the top of the list.Okay, if you're still reading, this could be a film you would enjoy. The movie is a Swedish production (English subtitles) and is an adaptation of the first book in author Stieg Larsson's award-winning series. From what I gather, the film remains extremely faithful to the book, all the way to a nearly two and a half hour run time. The story is quite twisted and is rather well woven with many layers. The main plot revolves around a hot-shot reporter who has fallen on hard times (read: going to prison because he's been found guilty of libel) and is now hired by a dying old man to find his niece that has been missing for 40 years. Pretty standard stuff, until the pieces begin falling into place, and we learn that the main suspects are all family members. Then all bets are off and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo steams ahead as disturbing details are discovered one after another. As far as the story goes, it's a little better than your average mystery. It keeps you guessing and there are plenty of suspects to choose from. The real gem of the film is in the character of Lisbeth Salander (played by Noomi Rapace), she of ""girl with the dragon tattoo"" fame. Lisbeth has been spying on Mikael Blomkvist (our unfortunate reporter) and unintentionally ends up getting herself involved in his latest project. Her character is a very complicated one. She's a hacker, covered in piercings, smokes like a chimney to calm herself down, has a very hidden and dark past including criminal activity, is withdrawn and stand-offish and yet she ends up being almost lovable. Rapace's performance is definitely a highlight of the movie. She manages Lisbeth's facial expressions and moods with ease and gives us exactly what Larsson wanted the character to be. Unfortunately, her supporting cast and the general low-budget feel of the film don't do her any favors... she can't save it on her own.The ""book vs. movie"" debate is alive and well here. Despite being a cinema lover, I usually prefer the book, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo did nothing to change my mind. It's a decent thriller, but the unnecessarily violent sex scenes and nature of the crimes act as shock value and don't add much meaningful to the story. However, I commend the director for staying true to the book and being unafraid to depict these same scenes as they were written. If that sounds like a bit of a contradiction, it is. And that is where I am left when it comes to my thoughts on the film - confused.I enjoyed it well enough, but was not blown away or inspired or emotionally riveted. I will definitely be viewing the sequels if for no other reason than to see more of Rapace, but the movie did offer up a solid crime mystery and for that I'll consider it slightly above average.",7.0,0,1

Is also the one with the more developed characters of the saga and the one with a more obvious meaning behind it.

"A more apt title for this film would be ""Slow Burning"". You could say that this film falls into the ""genre-switching"" category that Parasite did last year. The only caveat to that being, the first of the two genres for this film is just nothing. In total sincerity, I cannot tell you what purpose the slow and puttering first half of this film served that could not have been done in half the time. This might be my American short attention span talking, but it was truly a struggle to get through.And what was my reward? A slightly more interesting, but still underwhelming, second half. I think the main issue this film has is that it's main character is supposed to be a quiet writer that's more than meets the eye, but this characters dialog and the actors performance just make him come off as having some sort of mental disability. I suppose this was supposed to contrast to the suave, rich 3rd point of the love triangle in this film, played by Steven Yeun, who's sociopathic performance is easily the best thing about this film. Maybe narration would have helped me to better understand the main character. I just don't think enough context was given to explain his personality and actions. If ambiguity was the point, I disagree with the point. It's well shot and an interesting window into Korean culture with a great Steven Yeun performance, but the plot and main character make this difficult to recommend for me, despite it receiving tons of critical praise.",4.0,1,0

"Gravity is a fun ""Ride"" ala Star Tours experience, but as far as a ""Movie"" goes, the story and character development leaves much to be desired.

The CG and Camera moves were impressive and the film was done very well.  Films like Gravity are just not what I am looking for when I go to the Cinema. Now If I was at Disneyland it would be a different story   Just my two cents, and obviously I am in the minority since it appears that almost everyone on earth loved this Film and thought it was the greatest film of all time.  Which I do find a bit disconcerting because in my opinion it would not even make my top 100 films of all time list.   Sadly this is certainly the type of movies film corporations will want to put out more of.  3D up-charge along with a short running time which equals more showings per day and more revenue.

Peppy (Bejo) is the love-struck mega movie star trying to help him. Her affections (obsession?) for him seems to make no sense. The dialogue cards are few and do not help much to move the story along. The music, an integral part of any silent black-and-white movie, seems to be, at times, irrelevant to the plot.

"After watching Episode VII, here is my synopsis for Episode VIII: The movie begins on an ice planet, where a First Order probe has landed. The probe identifies the new location of the Resistance base on the planet. Meanwhile, inside the base, Finn wakes up and finds out that Rey has left. He then indicates his wishes to find her. Before he sets off, the base is attacked by First Order troops. Cue battle scene where Poe and Finn kick ass. Finn then sets off to find Rey. Back at the Island planet seen at the end of Episode VII, Luke trains Rey in the ways of the Force. Luke is amazed that Rey grasps the concepts of the Force so easily and already knows so much. Luke naturally thinks nefarious thoughts and thinks something is not quite right. Back in space, Finn is captured by the First Order. Rey senses this through her incredible knowledge of the Force and sets of to find him, despite Luke's warning that she is not ready and she needs to complete her training. Rey flies to the Star Destroyer Finn is held on. After kicking Stormtrooper ass, she comes face to face with Kylo Ren (again). Ren gives a speech about how he is now more powerful since he has completed his training. Cue the inevitable lightsaber fight where, at the end of the battle, it is revealed that Ren and Rey are siblings. ""Noooooooo"" proclaims Rey who then proceeds to slice off one of Kylo Ren's limbs.

Fight scenes are just OK with the standard fast editing so you can't tell what's going on, and of course we have the ubiquitous boring car chase that I wish movies would stop doing.

"IT IS THE BEST HARRY POTTER FILM. The plot is easily understandable to those who have not read the book, as the last 202 pages of the deathly hallows is put into 2 hours of film allowing for more depth. The fight scenes are interesting, enough to keep peoples attention. Overall i would give this 8.5 not 10 simply because i have read the books and the film did not give credit to some of the characters. For example Bellatrix Lestrange, she is made into some top deather witch who is a really powerful witch in the books but looks nothing special in the films because all she does is get killed by Molly Weasley. In the book she fights hermionie, ginny and luna all at the same time then molly comes in, they should have done this in the film, it would have been one or two minutes at the most. The same with Voldemort, ok the fight scene between him and Harry is TEN TIMES BETTER than in the book, but Voldemort doesn't look powerful to people who have not read the book, it doesn't show him fighting Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minerva Mcgonagall and Horace Slughorn at the same time then blowing them away with a force explosion when he sees Bellatrix die. Then Harry fights him. This would have been added a max of 5 minutes to the film but would have made it so much better. Should of shown Remus and Tonks dying, and Fred dieng, but it did add things that weren't in the book. Neville on the bridge was interesting and exciting to watch.

"Big Dumb Awesome Motor Fueled wasteland movie.that's how I'd sum this up, the entire movie from start to finish is basically a heavy metal world made as realistically as possible.Now, I've been out of the loop ever since he original mad max, but I get the feeling that the world changed since the old days, and that, despite all the stuff you're seeing and how alien the movie looks from the starting point to now, that mad max is very much not a reboot.The movie is dumb, let me be clear here, virtually everything, the entire plot, all of it, stupid.but it's the reason it's stupid is because the movie is using its plot as a blatant excuse to watch car armies blow each other up in a wasteland so convincingly alien in nature that it's hard to believe this place used to be earth, it feels more like mars, one of the big standout moments being the massive dust-storm which was so large, so violent that it was generating electricity.it's clear that mad max is telling its tale through the world, and not through the main character, back in the day I recall max being a guy who actually spoke and did stuff, this later version of max feels noticeably broken, and he's quiet throughout the entire movie, save for internal monologue and him giving orders or just saying his name twice near the end. in fact, my biggest gripe with mad max is how max himself just....isn't.there's not much to him, and the only moment you really see him doing something badass, he does it in the background, he basically goes off to deal with the people pursuing their war vehicle at night, the air is quiet and a lot of waiting happens.then suddenly this massive explosion, muffled by the fog in the area, resounds off in the distance, and max comes in, coated with blood and carrying a ton of supplies from the guys he just discreetly destroyed.there's this sense that max isn't really trying, and when he finally does do something badass, it's almost scary, they don't say anything when he returns, they just move on.Max himself is very reserved, he's not interested in helping these people until the very end, he suffers from hallucinations, and he's genuinely ""Mad"" as the title of the movie makes clear.the movie's plot itself is stupid, lead chick takes concubines from warlord, warlord gets mad, goes after them, pregnant concubine dies when warlord accidentally runs her over, warlord gets madder.near the end of the journey, the group realizes ""Hey, warlord was being stupid and took his ENTIRE ARMY FROM THE CITADEL! let's go back and take it over!"" warlord dies, happy ending.Immortan joe, like max, suffers from being a background villain, he gets a decent amount of screentime, speaks more, but there's not much in the way of his character development, save for what  you see in the world around him. Joe is living a lie and trying to turn it into a functional society, he's a bad guy, but for human reasons. but there's little in the way of his character outside of ""shouty guy in horse tooth mask who owns people and makes them do his bidding"" and that's about it. virtually every other line he has is him shouting orders, and that's about it. Mad Max is a solid movie, not for what it tells through the characters, but what it tells through the world, and this world is masterfully created. it's a compelling look at a ludicrous, insane wasteland that shapes the people. Max himself needed more characterization, as he seems to be the only person the wasteland doesn't say much about. It's a stupid, explosive, crazy, dumb, awesome movie that doesn't need to do much to say a lot. but when you step back and take a look at the plot, it's **** stupid.in fact, it's the level of stupid that you just can't hate yourself for enjoying, because the stupid is the best excuse to sit back and admire the action, the craziness, the guy in a flamethrower guitar. it's just one big dumb awesome heay metal fantasy movie, and that's all it wants to be.",9.0,0,1

"I think this movie to some extent left me disappointed (Much like Lincoln, just lesser). I was left confused because I went to see (As name suggests) a movie full of spies. But it started with a rather legal drama flavour and proceeded to the second half as thriller and ended with .. Well I don't know what to call the ending. I was so confused about what is going on in James Donovan's mind or what is his code of conduct which is making him make odd choices. That part is for writer. Now what I missed the most was John Williams, a movie like this could have worked a lot better with a progressive score to compliment it's pace but Thomas Newman's work is highly mediocre.On the bright side, Tom Hanks was very good with the performance. His best since Charlie Wilson's War (resemblance between both characters as negotiators and involvement of Russia). Costumes, Editing and Sets were worth praising too.Biggest thumb down towards Mr. Speilberg for using very old tactics of basing the humour between two key characters, in this case James Danavon and Rudolf Abel (both contender for Oscar), did not work. Same joke too many times. And movie also lacked intensity. There was not a single moment we felt that James' plan would not fall through.Overall, movie is watch-able for it's not mater much departments, which makes it not much enjoyable.",6.0,0,1

" A fragmented cinematic effort. At times a beautiful postcard of Africa, a love story that never emerges fully, a theme that never reaches a crescendo or a climax, and acting that is just above the average. An excellent theme ruined by a bad script and not so great directing. Compared to Munich (which also carries an anthemic and current affairs theme) this is just a shadow of a movie. Ralph Fiennes is the only light in this wasted opportunity. He carries the movie and all the actors around him. The fundamental problem is that this movie wanders off aimlessly or without any real destination. The pharmaceutical ""villans"" are not portrayed as they should have, the suffering of the African people without proper medication is not given as it should and there is no real momentum in this whole story. I don't think Fernando Meirelles nor John Le Carré really worked together here. All in all a wonderful opportunity wasted.",4.0,1,0

"Positives: J.K. Simmons is terrifying, and really great. He plays a manipulative, abusive teacher that every student fears and longs to please. Lots of times movies with music as a central theme have fake playing in them that is distracting. This movie is filmed in such a way that the fake playing isn't distracting. In fact, if you don't know better, you won't know the difference. The story has a ton of interest and holds your attention. There are quite a few shocks along the way. The Negative: Plot holes...plenty of them. One or two are acceptable...but they became a distraction. I wish they would have explored the family dynamic more, especially attitudes favoring sports over music. I think they wrote Simmon's dialogue a little over the top.

This is the 'Blair Witch' school of acting, where the exhaustion and annoyance of a real life actor is used as lazy short hand for some sort of transcendent terror that the film is too slavish to it's capital C 'Craft' to ever achieve.

" Some viewers of ""The Queen"" will heed Tracy Ullman's outcry and nod in agreement about those stubborn royals needing to defrost their collective upper lips and pay their respects to ""the people's princess""; while the rest of us will take stock that Ullman's televised soapbox is beaming from Hollywood, California. The filmmaker used Ullman because her attitude is indicative of an environment and industry, which encourages its denizens to display emotion, to cry on cue when the cameras are rolling. In my opinion, we're supposed to make the connection between this expatriate and the British people who queued up in front of Buckingham Palace with their bouquets and tear-streaked faces. This public display of grief is put on by people who seek the limelight, the film seems to be implying, just like those Hollywood notables who attended Princess Di's funeral. In a style befitting the late land-mine crusader's memory, well-wishers who wanted to truly honor Diana Spencer's memory, quite ironically, should've enacted the queen's way, the prudent way; which was to mourn in private, so as not to give the media something to shoot; the media who eventually killed her. ""The Queen"" is clearly on her majesty's side. In a crafty move on the filmmaker's part, we never get a reaction shot from the queen when she receives news of both, Princess Di's accident and death.

" The Devil and Daniel Johnston is a well enough done film, and benefits greatly from archival film from various sources, but ultimately is somewhat difficult to appreciate if you are not a manic music fan of some sort. You certainly do feel sorry for Daniel Johnston, his has been a rough life, and I give the filmmakers credit there, for this could easily degenerated into a ""this guy was nuts"" sort of thing. And if you get the DVD, whatch the extras, as parts of his obsessions are more fully explained. But ultimately, for the non-manic non-Dylan type music non-fan, the film gets a little tedious, so I don't regret watching it, but it was really not the best film of the year. Daniel Johnston has done some amazing things over the years, and you certainly get a good feel for what he's been through, and maybe just at the end appreciate the progress in treatment as you can see him clear up some (hopefully not at the loss of his art), but still a bit of a slog at times.",5.0,1,0

"It was okay. Basically a well-dramatised account of the hunt for Bin Laden, but suffers from a too-long running time. The acting is very average, the script sparse, the dialogue terrible, the plot surprisingly thin. For a film that tries to chart the hunt for arguably the biggest boogieman in US history, it's a very empty film. The ONLY reason that the film succeeds is because of it's subject matter. Without that, it's just a recreation documentary without any of the interesting documentary information. The scriptwriter, Mark Boal, struggles to write a coherent narrative, and seems to resort to choppy little vingettes instead. I don't know if that was a conscious decision, or a lack of skill. It's worth seeing on video, and only because of the subject material. As a narrative documentary it's great; as a film it sucks.",6.0,0,1

"TDKR is the final chapter in an epic trilogy that made sure that even superhero movies could be for grown-ups too instead of trashy camp fests. I wonder if these movies would have been as successful if Heath Ledger hadn't died but we'll never know. It's impossible to talk about the movie without spoilers but I'll do my best to avoid them. Bruce Wayne is at his worst in the beginning of the movie, he's lost the will to fight, live, be a part of the world. He made Batman take the blame for Harvey Dent and this act made sure that the ""death of batman"" brought the ""death of the man"". The quest to go back alive and kicking is triggered when a certain cat-burglar tries to steal  jewel from the Wayn Mansion. The theft uncovers a bigger scheme where the Wayne Empire is the target. Plot twist after plot twist we meet new characters, each one with their own backstory, from Selina Kyle to agent Blake, to the menacing Bane. While Joker liked to play with minds, Bane's strength is its best asset, every time he appears you're scared of what would he do next. He's a solid character, but I think he's not enough menacing on his own but needs a full army to back him up. Bane and his army gain control of the entire town of gotham and it's up the ""good people"" to save the day. While in the earlier movie Batman was used as a symbol instead of an actual action hero, here he shines through gadgets and futuristic veihcles. There are a lot of action scenes that escalate in the climax of the movie.Overall I suggest to see the movie, it's a fitting end to a surprisingly good trilogy.",9.0,0,1

" I just finished reading a book on Kubrick. The chapter on FMJ was interesting in pointing out certain scenes where I missed some or most of Kubrick's point. In the prostittue/theater scene, I realized that only in the widescreen version of the film could you see certain background visuals. At present FMJ is available in letterboxed format from Warner Bros. only in HD DVD, which is where the DVD technology is headed. They (Congress is included in ""they."") want us to start all over again in both the player and disc. It's really unfair. The picture is much better, but, using FMJ as an example, I've bought it in VHS, then DVD, then again in 5.1 SS DVD, and would buy it again in letterboxed format, but switching to a new DVD format is asking too much. Apparently, we're missing a good bit in this modified version of the film. I've emailed WB's site, pleading for a widescreen release in the present DVD format and maybe they would if enough people showed an interest. This excellent, very intelligent and challenging film deserves release in its proper format without having to buy a $1,000.00 DVD player. Among comtemporary filmmakers, Kubrick was without peers and I would rank him above Welles, though I'm sure this comment will cause many film buffs to go ape.",10.0,0,1

Also, his cadence was similar to Hug Weaving in The Matrix to such an extent that it was distracting. The actor who played Eli was not very good. I thought the score was awesome and the cinematography was brilliant. I almost feel like the critics were afraid to give this a bad review.

"The special effects were great, cinematography was good and the acting was excellent. I like the new characters and thought what I learned of them was enough for this episode. I've been a Star Wars fan since I saw the movie in '77 I was 7. I'm probably one of the few people in the world that loved the prequels (knew it wasn't going to be an action-based movie), and I walked into this movie with no expectations. I knew the expanded universe was off the table, and expected an entirely different story.  If the Force Awakens was a reboot, I would have loved it to death. But, it's not; it's the seventh chapter in the series. I've never had a problem with the suspension of disbelief, until this movie. As soon as I saw Rey on the Tatooine clone I knew she was the new jedi. Because she looks a lot like Padme, I assumed she was Luke's daughter, which was revealed in her last flashback. It appears that the Janitor storm trooper will  be another jedi given enough time as he can magically use the lightsaber. Ben is a Revanite knockoff like Sidious was supposed to be, wearing the Vader/Anakin/Revan gear with Revan's upgraded mask. Han dies, which wasn't a shock as Ford always hated the idea of doing more movies. I'm sure Luke will die in the next movie as Hamill has been more bitter about the movies than Ford was. Fisher will probably stay on as long as she can because of $. The acorn looking chick is the new yoda, Finn and Rey the new love interest, and as always the 3rd Reich can't make a death star without the obvious back door clause cause evil. I can honestly go with all of that. Seriously. Fine. Whatever. It's Star Wars not Hamlet. I'm not expecting a masterpiece after 38 years. But it's still A New Hope mixed with Empire, and I've seen those movies at least 100 times since their launch. I just wanted new. I don't want a nostalgia piece. Chapters 3-6 were great for their time, but life marches on. Throwing out the expanded universe opened the door to a whole new universe, and Lucas bowing out removed the need to work through his WWII therapy. It's a marketing masterpiece, and a fun Star Wars film with great new characters that I love. But the story is tired and played out. I honestly hope the next once amps up the story is veers away from the predictable setup they've laid at out feet.",5.0,1,0

"Straightforward no frills, well acted, investigative journalistic procedural based on true story; heavy on dialogue as you'd expect but short on vigor, suspense, emotional payoffs, and an overall sense of urgency.  Sorry but a tough subject alone does not grant a pass for great movie.  The craftsmanship is solid, though no flair for moviemaking is evident in this only mildly involving story.  This same movie aesthetically could have come out in 2001 or in 1970, whether that's a problem or not is not the issue, but the low key to the point of nearly emotionless arch is.  It is there however subtle making it more realistic but also less satisfying as movie artifice.  It does not deserve Best Picture and is a prime example of serious content alone trumping form.  Ruffalo does not deserve the nom any more than every other member of the ensemble, that is besides Rachel McAdams who is a good actress but any of literally hundreds of others could easily play this part to the same effect.The basic problem with this movie and what most of the worthless dopey critics next door ignore because of their bias and incompetence is it's underwhelming!",5.0,1,0
"This ‘All About Eve’ wannabe suffers from an excess of talk and is pretentious in the extreme. Lacking ‘Eve’s style, wit and deliciously rendered performances this film irritates more than it entertains. Juliette Binoche plays Maria Enders, a mature actress who is approached to star in a play that launched her career 20 years earlier. This time she has been asked to interpret the older role of a middle aged business woman, a lesbian who is being manipulated by her young female assistant. In reality, her own assistant played by Kirsten Stewart coaxes her into playing the role. Thus the heart of the film becomes about the two actresses sparring with each other as Binoche tries to come to grips with a role with which she is unable to identify. As these discussions and the subsequent confrontations change their working dynamic the line between the play and reality becomes blurred. As a story outline it all sounds very promising and the actresses, particularly Stewart, give it their best shot. However, they are ultimately let down by the material which disintegrates badly in the mid- section as the two women disagree over aspects of the play and characters. Lovers of pretension will surely run out of superlatives for all the mumbo jumbo spouted. Others, myself included, will merely disengage and lose interest. Surprisingly the film actually rallies a little when Stewart disappears from the scene. This is in not a reflection on her performance, which is probably the best in the film, but it gives a little more mystery and anticipation as to where the drama is going. Unfortunately, a rather ambiguous parting moment is also the final nail in the coffin for a film that never fully gets you on its side.",4.0,1,0
"You know how when a friend is telling you a personal anecdote that he thinks is hilarious, but you don't find very funny, he'll say ""you had to have been there.""

Putting all that aside (if that's even possible), I still didn't enjoy this movie. I found myself checking how much more I had to sit through multiple times. And having seen what Al Pacino is capable of, he seems very wooden in this.  My conclusion is that if you managed to see this movie before pop culture appropriated it and fed you their versions, then you'll likely love it.

"Should've seen it coming when the A24 logo flashed at the beginning. Everything they produce is overlong, slow, pretentious, boring, and dumb, the type of movies where they just point a camera at people doing nothing or the most absurd/exploitative thing they can think of and then the demented types who enjoy these kinds of films tell you you're a braindead idiot if you didn't ""get it"" and derive great meaning from the 2 hours of brutality, **** and nothingness. Every time I've seen one of their films I feel like I'm just looking into the creators' mental illnesses, and not in an enlightening way. I can safely say I'll never watch another A24 film after three bombs in a row with this, The Witch, and Hereditary. Films like these are indicative of the problem with our lost, bored, consumer culture of people leading directionless lives where they feel no self-empowerment to create meaning in their lives.

The moral always seems to be self-defeating, encouraging viewers to become depraved to escape the challenges of life. Utter **** There's no skill involved in creating these movies aside from an occasional well-framed shot. The acting is deadpan to the extent non-actors could pull it off, and the use of classical music tricks naive people into thinking they're watching something artistic and distinguished. The fact that they got a child involved in this demented production shows you the morals of the actors.

"Zero Dark Thirty was not the movie I expected. I went in expecting more of an international thriller involving the capture of Osama Bin Laden but the movie has much more of a crime drama feel to it. It's very slow and has almost no action whatsoever. That's not necessarily a bad thing it's just not what I expected based on the trailers for the film. I will also say this: The critics have highly overrated this film. Now don't get me wrong, I do not mean to make this review sound negative because I thought it was a really well made movie. The acting, especially by Jessica Chastain was superb. She's truly one of the best female actresses out there and I expect her to have many more leading roles in the near future. I also thought that the way the movie focused on her struggles to fight for her stance was well done. Lastly, I loved how the film ignored any political bias whatsoever. I was worried that there would be a slight liberal slant in the film and I didn't think there was any. With the way media is today, that was refreshing. The only negatives I had were that the ending wasn't done as well as it could've been and didn't feel like it fit with the tone of the movie. Also, the director decided to break up the movie into chapters for some reason and that was a terrible decision. The film flowed just fine without it but that added an episodic element that made a long movie feel even longer. Nonetheless, it was a good movie that was enjoyable, albeit long, to watch.",8.0,0,1
"THERAPY FOR STAR WARS FANS.  Long-time Star Wars fans out there, I feel your pain.  I am your pain.  I've loved this franchise since 1977, and after 38 years, it is over for us.  JJ played it safe by making a movie that was sure to appeal to younger viewers who never cared much for Star Wars but would crush the hearts of long-time fans, a stunning new experience for newbies, a problem-ridden remake to the rest of us.  Why did he do it?  Because younger viewers are where the money is.  Ignorant of the fact that this is just a sad cobbling together of scenes from the classic films, younger viewers are gobbling it up as if it’s a stunning new breakthrough film.  They just don't know any better, and that's the whole idea.  Blind to what they are actually seeing, they are paying hand over fist for this movie while those of us in the know sit in slack-jawed amazement at the travesty that we are witnessing.  There is just no gentle way to put it.  JJ Abrams has sold us out. But here is how we have to deal with this.  Yes, we were all looking forward to another chapter in the Star Wars saga, and yes we are all disappointed that we didn't get it.  But there is no changing that now.  What's done is done.  That being the case, what we must now realize is this.  There is only one way that we could have possibly enjoyed this film and the future installments as well.  We would have to watch them in the same condition of ignorance that these younger fans are in.  In other words, we would have to have never seen and loved the classic films that captivated us so.  We would have to erase from our past the amazement and the wonder that Star Wars has given us for all of these decades.  Yes, it would have been great to have enjoyed this movie, but such enjoyment could only have been purchased at the price of the original epics.  No one who has ever been truly moved by this Franchise would ever accept such a tradeoff.  Let the younger viewers have this film and those to come.  Let them enjoy this shadow of the original under the delusion that they are witnessing an innovative new marvel.  Let them do all of this while we rest firm in the knowledge that what we ourselves experienced was the true masterpiece, an irreplaceable treasure that these merely derivative new episodes simply will never be.",0.0,1,0

Continuing from where Batman Begins ended peerless director Christopher Nolan reunites with Christian Bale for the continuing story of The Dark Knight. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent Batman sets out to put a halt to the criminal activity that plagues Gotham City. Just as everything seems to be going their way the peace is shattered by a criminal mastermind known as The Joker. Batman may be on the DVD cover but this is really The Jokers movie. Following the death of Heath Ledger prior to the movies release there was huge hype regarding his performance and he certainly delivers. His portrayal is a far cry from the camp 1960s iteration and as creepy and disturbing as any villain in cinema history. Running at about two and a half hours in length The Dark Knight needed a worthwhile plot to go with the high quality action scenes and on this count the movie again doesn't fail featuring plenty of twists and surprises.

The beautifully conducted stop motion technique, the catchy musical numbers that may not be counted as Danny Elfman’s compositional masterpieces, but still make the movie a lot more entertaining than it would have been without them, and the weird sort of humour that isn’t to make you laugh out loud, but have you chuckling almost perpetually. Nevertheless, it’s still a bit disappointing that a movie this sort can still be boring here and there and the screenplay also isn’t always successful in maintaining an acceptable balance between child-oriented silliness and adult-suitability (though I adore the Hamlet reference). Through that, difficulties arise as the movie ends up being too ridiculous for most adults and too scary for most kids in the target audience. But still I’d say that sparing one hour and fifteen minutes to see this truly one-of-a-kind movie can’t hurt.",5.0,1,0

I'm not saying that in the end everything should have worked out and they lived out their lives together, but the ending was terrible, I was struggling to even bring a tear to my eye because it was obvious that Ennes didn't share Jack's feelings about love and happiness, granted it would be difficult in those times to live a happy life as a gay couple, but Ennes also displayed little emotion at the end of the movie, and I really can't say anything else besides this movie was dissapointing.

" I sat in the cinema wondering whether the film - a sort of Jackass-cum-Candid Camera, written and played by an undergrad of limited intellect and even less comedic talent - was the same film as acclaimed by critics. There were some funny moments in the first half but the second half dragged with few laughs and some misplaced attempts at pathos. This comedy was also mean-spirited - exploiting the Romanian (where it was filmed) villagers like performing monkeys for a few dollars a day in bit parts aimed at confirming Borat's stereotypical Third World attitudes and behaviour - a dubious activity from which Baron Cohen has made a considerable number of fast bucks. Thank God the man has left Britain and gone to settle in that mixture of concrete and desert known as Los Angeles where he should feel right at home with other amoral mega-egos. Hopefully, when he next minces onto the big screen as Bruno the fashionista, all will see him coming and be able to avoid his entrapment into another low-brow comedy epic that appeals to the 'Frat brothers' in his (mainly male) side-split audience. PS - although the films fans are wetting themselves trying to prove what a nasry reflection it is of the US+A, there were only a few bigots present in the film I viewed and most people who were foxed into appearing came across as endlessly patient and kind towards this drip of a man (in any culture) known as Borat.",2.0,1,0

"The Dark Knight Rises feels like a six year old retold what they remembered of Batman Begins with nothing of The Dark Knight aside from Harvey Dent to a screen writer, who then wrote a sequel.  It feels like Inception without the concept of dreams.  It flirts with greatness but never reaches it.  It's not The Dark Knight.  It's closer to X3 in the way that it marginalizes characters and fails to deliver the promise of the series as a whole.  Viewed not as a sequel to one of the few (if not the only) comic book films to ever win an oscar?  It still isn't very good.  There are moments of brilliance, and moments of frustration.  There are many plot threads that go nowhere.  The scene in the prison between Ra's and Bruce is one of the most amazing scenes I've seen in a film in years.  Yet other scenes that should have been just as amazing, such as Alfred and Bruce's goodbye ring hollow; as if the writers stopped caring about the characters, or never understood them in the first place.  Within five minutes of one love interest being removed a second one crops up, ensuring the ending is a heart string tugging mess. But rather than delve into all of that, let's just examine one of the final scenes: Batman in The Bat chasing down the truck.  Talia and an unnamed man are in the cabin of the truck.  Batman, after evading missiles, flies directly in front of said truck and opens fire.  Right at the cabin.  With two large guns.  And the driver dies.  Talia takes over, as if nothing has changed.  But this, this massive flaw in internal logic, this glaring hole in the conceptualization of the film and it's protagonist exemplifies everything that is wrong with The Dark Knight Rises.  Right at the end of the movie Batman breaks his ""one rule"" without a second's hesitation, and worse, without any moral debate about doing so.  A flashback to the interrogation in The Dark Knight with the Joker stating that people drop their moral code at the first sign of trouble could have made this scene into something of undeniable power.  But instead, nothing.  He clearly was not willing to cross this line when he flew into the final battle between the police and the citizens, or in his final battle with Bane.  It could easily be said that Batman has accidentally killed many people.  The League of Shadows fire comes to mind, as does the crashing of the train, or the chase scene in Begins that Alfred hand waves away by saying ""it's a miracle that no one was hurt."". These are leaps of faith or suspensions of disbelief: Batman is trying to do the right thing, and this sometimes has unforeseen consequences.   But flying directly in front of a vehicle and opening fire on it's cabin, killing a man?  This is not accidental.  Even if the entire city was at risk, this does not justify ignoring Batman's moral compass by murdering a man without pause.  Talia's death came from wounds suffered when the truck fell off of the road; a mirror of her father's death.  It can be viewed as accidental.  But the driver's cannot.  In The Avengers Thor hits Captain America's shield with his hammer without any understanding of what the shield is made out of, and it's arguable that he tried to kill him with that attack.  But that movie isn't built around heroes who never kill, it's built around fun.  It's impossible to believe that Batman didn't know what could happen when he opened fire.  A good comic book movie obscures these facts.  X2 for example starts to falter when you realize how many people died when Xavier momentarily cripples every human on the planet.  But it was not his intention. And therein lies the problem. I enjoyed much of The Dark Knight Rises, but can't say it's a good film by any means.  If it was made in a different country I would have felt like I simply didn't understand their culture and blown it off.  And I am the kind of person who loves comic book movies, both realistic and campy.  Despite this, I'm sure that most of my words will be ignored, and I'll be labeled a ""hater"" for not blindly loving the film. I tried writing a full review of the film, in all of it's wonder and drudgery, but couldn't get it below 5000 characters.  So I leave it with this one concept and it's obvious and massive flaw: Batman murders a man and the film doesn't blink an eye over it.",5.0,1,0
"where you spend your time..You Were Never Really HereThe bisection of the scrutiny is so convoluted that it allows the audience to work for it (that raises question whether it is worth it or not? and unfortunately it isn't) which is always good but if it fails to seek attention through this whole process the impact grows shallow. Having said that, the cinematography is utterly beautiful; despite the tone of the feature, there are few genuinely moving scenes like when the protagonist crushes a mint or his bitterly sweet moments with his mother. Lynne Ramsay; the director and screen writer, is no short on execution but its the script that never had enough crisp in the first place to blend in with the viewers. Joaquin Phoenix; at the heart of it, is so good that it aches you to see such a talent go waste by. You Were Never Really Here has short runtime which favors on its side along with brilliant execution, amazing cinematography and heart felt performances but unfortunately all of this is piled up on by this overthought out script that never reaches its destination.",5.0,1,0
"The Good: Rey is amazing, Han is amazing (really brings the energy). Overall a very fun adventure. Well directed. Can't wait for episode 8.The Bad: The betrayal of Han was really inappropriate. Not the fact it happened, but the way in which it was done -- Star Wars is supposed to be a story of redemption, not of a son pretending to turn to the light side to murder his father, arguably the most loved hero in the franchise, without any chance of defending himself. It's a cheap hollywood emotion trick, where everything the movie says is that he's going to turn to the light side, and then says ""psyke! just kidding, we lied"". Additionally, there is so much fan service done to A New Hope it felt like the movie was a joke at times. I enjoyed the prequels, and this felt like the producers were so afraid of being unpopular by the outspoken haters, they re-made A New Hope in a different setting. Give it time and I think people will see this movie doesn't stand on its own - that is, without knowing it was made to appease OT fans, it will be really confusing to watch.",4.0,1,0
"- The first structural problem with the story is that the first half up until Killmonger (LOL @ that name) shows up is a pointless head fake. We don't care about ""Ulysses Klaw"" or what he did 30 years before the movie starts, so hunting him and his 5lb slab of MacGuffinite isn't an interesting or constructive motivation. Its only purpose is to set up the Shocking Twist where Killmonger emerges as the real villain with a totally separate villain agenda of his own, at which point the real movie begins. Not an effective use of runtime.- The second problem is that Chadwick Boseman (LOL at this name too, also I'm 99% sure this guy is just a palette swap of Chiwetel Ejiofor) doesn't really have a character arc or any internal conflict. On this front the movie compares unfavorably to the somewhat similar Thor, which was still pretty meh but at least forced its title character to grow and develop. The decision Boseman makes at the end of the movie to open Wakanda up to the world is arbitrary, and his very sensible initial reasons for refusing to do so are never addressed.- The thing that jumped out at me most about the aesthetics is the way they deliberately avoided making the Wakandans sophisticated and civilized in any way other than their technology. Other than the sci-fantasy trappings they are 100% face-painted, ritual-scarified, garishly-dressed, bone-in-nose, ancestor-worshiping, ape-hooting (yes, Man-Ape is in the movie, though they never call him by that name) savages straight out of the opening of Zulu. It's very cargo cult, and leads to bizarre moments like the ending battle where some people are fighting with high-tech pulse rifles and fighter drones while others do melee combat with ordinary spears and yet others fight with RHINO CAVALRY. Ultimately though none of the Wakandan technology is any more impressive than the SHIELD helicarrier or the stuff Tony Stark has been building in his garage for the last 10 years.- There's lots of blurry, weightless, underwhelming CGI, especially in the big final setpiece. Some of the Black Panther stuff didn't look much better than the original Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movie.- Marvel heroes vary a lot in how powerful they are portrayed, and in this case the guy is just good at gymnastics and kang fu and has a bulletproof suit. Makes for stale fight scenes, especially since for 2 of them he doesn't even have his suit or powers available. Say what you will about Ant-Man and Dr Strange, they at least had visually interesting and creative action.- ""Killmonger"" is one of the better villains the MCU has had (a low bar), mostly because he's just about the only guy in the movie with a personality. Still, Michael B. Jordan has yet to top the naturalism of his performance as a low-level drug dealer in season 1 of The Wire. In case you were curious his big villainous plot is to usurp the throne of Wakanda and distribute its technology to black folk around the world so they can use it to kill whitey (after he seizes power the rest of the noble, enlightened Wakandans just shrug and go along with his plan, because the script requires it). I can just about guarantee there are SJW types writing articles right now arguing that he is the true hero of the movie.- There are snarky little digs at whites sprinkled throughout, but less than I expected. The main thing that sticks in my mind is the smugness that gets directed at whites who ignorantly mistake Wakandans for typical Africans and not SECRET CYBER-KANGZ. They also take a limp little shot at Trump in the final UN speech where a character talks about needing to ""build bridges, not barriers"".- Final thought: the metaphysics of the Marvel universe are really screwed up at this point. Advanced galaxy-spanning alien civilizations are real, Norse gods are real (though they're technically just more aliens), ancient African animistic voodoo spirits are real, Eastern hippie stoner magic is real, superhuman AI is real, hyper-powerful reality-warping space gems are real, secret 80-year-old Nazi conspiracies are real, and of course Kangz are real as real can be, bigot. They've long since given up pretending any of this hangs together coherently. Compared to the painstaking way Nolan managed the setting of the Dark Knight movies or Snyder handled the Man of Steel movies, it really makes the unwieldy, spackled-over nature of the MCU stand out.",0.0,1,0

"A performance such as 19-year-old Amandla Stenberg gives in “The Hate U Give” is one that I haven’t seen since I saw Charlize Theron in her Oscar-winning role in “Monster”.  Sadly, because of who she is, she probably won’t get any Oscar recognition for her performance.Stenberg plays Starr Carter, a Black girl who in the evenings and weekends spends time in the ghetto living with her parents, brother and half-brother while during the week goes to a private, white, elite school where she feels she is ‘Starr 2” to avoid being stereotyped.One night she is at a party and a friend, a boy, Khalil, played by Algee Smith, she has known since childhood offers to drive her home. Within 10 minutes Khalil, a black boy, who fails to signal when switching lanes is pulled over by a white policeman and when he reaches for a hairbrush is shot. Starr, handcuffed, watches her friend bleed out and die.Many people have heard about ‘the talk’ black parents have to have with their children, they have seen television newscasts and read accounts of many black kids being shot by while police with the former dying and the latter not paying any price for what they have done.This is a film that shows what the talk is about, what black kids and families go through and have to face. It takes us behind the newscasts we see and hear. Audrey Wells wrote the screenplay based on the book by Angie Thomas takes us into the mind of a young black girl, Starr, and allows us to see exactly how she is affected by not only those around her but by life.We meet her father Maverick (Russell Hornsby) an ex-convict, who has opened his own store and early in the film gives the ‘talk, to his 3 kids explaining what to do not if but when they are stopped by the police. His wife Lisa (Regina Hall) loves her husband and sees him through the bad times in his life and is now they embarrass their children by expressing their love to each other.Maverick’s brother, Carlos (Common) is a policeman and in talks with his niece Starr explains what a policeman goes through when he stops a black person as well as a white person.  We live what Starr goes through when threatened by a drug dealer named King (Anthony Mackie) because her telling the grand jury convened regarding whether to charge the policeman who killed her friend can get him into trouble and when an activist and lawyer, played by Issa Rae, guides her through that grand jury happenings and Starr’s conflict about whether to tell the truth or keep silent.This and much more, such as Starr having a white boyfriend, gets us inside her head about all that she is involved in and around her. Amanda Stenberg’s Starr lets us into the mind of a black teenager while the screenplay and the director, George Tillman, Jr., takes us behind the headlines, the lead stories and shows us what really happens.“The Hate U Give” is a must-see for many reasons including a performance by Amanda Stenberg that will be for her to beat and a movie that shows us that think we know it all know very little about other people.",10.0,0,1
" I watched this one last night and I wasn't impressed. What's the point of the film? What is the message of the film? Perhaps the point is to be a historical document in which case a message isn't necessarily appropriate. But if it's a historical document, (and I found myself thinking this during it) how much of it is actually historical? Was hot water really used as a weapon? Why, in a film supposedly about Flight 93, does more than half of it deal with the WTC? If the writer had simply accepted that his movie was not a documentary, he might've felt more liberated to engage in exploration of the some the rivettingly interesting dynamics that another director (like Oliver Stone) would be glad to have the opportunity to use to say something. As it is, we are left with a film that has either a completely distinct location from any film ever shot or a film with no location at all. Frankly, after watching it, I don't care which.

If you have any appreciation for the written word and how it can move like music when put in the hands of the right actors and director, then there's no way you walk away from this movie unsatisfied. The arc does a great job of illustrating the cunning determination in Jobs' pursuit of perfection, and how he used his genius to, both, trample over those that stood in his way and defy those championing the safe investment of sticking to the status quo. They may have glossed over how or whether he mended relationships with those he cast aside - and were vital to his success - but the end result was a moving picture of a flawed genius. Not every movie has to make you feel like your protagonist should be worshiped, and I don't believe this story does, but it makes you feel something about standing for your principles. And there are plenty of times not compromising on your principles can destroy you or the people around you (Jobs certainly did plenty of this), but, I believe, it's fair to say there were at least a few times his uncompromising/self-absorbed persona helped change the world - and it's all right to marvel that.",10.0,0,1

" Unlike some Best Picture nominees at the Academy, Good Night and Good Luck features some actual characters and a plot that isn't forced forward. It benefits from its plot progression being part of history instead of fiction, but still - even as a black and white film in the era of color - is a more genuine piece of film making than you would find in theatres that year. It's weakest points are its grimness and unrelenting moral stance, which inhibit it from exploring or debating these positions. In that sense, it is as much a black and white picture as it is a black and white story. Still, it earns what it makes of itself, and its contemporary political overtones are for the most part subdued enough to be something that could remain worthwhile viewing decades from now.",8.0,0,1

"Written by the Coens, directed by Stephen Speilberg, and starring Tom Hanks. That should be all you need to know. However, this movie, while good, is kind of boring. It's not even close to being as good as I had hoped it would be, and I didn't have super-high expectations anyway, as odd as that may sound. Don't get me wrong, it's good. But it's not THAT good. Tom Hanks was great as always, but it's not a stand-out role. Mark Rylance has been nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but he was just a good character. He could have been replaced by anybody and it would have been good. And on that note, this film should NOT be nominated for best picture. There were at least two other films that didn't get nominated that are far superior in every way that didn't get a nomination. It does have some interesting direction, and I liked the way it moved along at some points, but then there were a couple times when I didn't like how it went from one scene to another.

While it can be very silly, the humor mostly works and it can provide several laughs while watching.

"JFK has been assassinated and the First Lady (Natalie Portman) is left to pick up the pieces. We get to see what she must have been gone through. I know nothing about the authenticity of this work but the movie looks good and it's always interesting to see the human side of the great historical figures. On this count, „Jackie“ delivers. All the doubts, fear, frailty and pettiness you can watch, and then some.Portman gives a sharp nuanced performance and has a strong physical screen presence, especially for a widow broken down in grief and fear for the future.There are a lot of good actors involved, including Billy Crudup, Peter Sarsgaard as RFK, Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup, John Hurt, Richard E. Grant and John Carroll Lynch as Lyndon Johnson. But don't expect a strong ensemble movie, it's all about Jackie. Everybody else falls to the sidelines, ready to serve or interact when the main character when screenplay says so. But the acting’s impressive enough all around. So, everything good so far. But somehow.. the whole result is not. Sorry to put it bluntly but it felt boring as **** All Oscar-hunt and no soul. This is the most boring ""good movie"" I have watched since... well, two weeks or so, when I saw Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"".The 99 minute movie feels much longer, mostly because of its pompous style and no readiness to delve deep into any of the characters, or the experience of being human in general, which the story is actually about. The only time I really felt the experience truly coming alive for a moment was near the end, thanks to the great late John Hurt as priest councelling the First Lady.„Jackie“ was nominated for 120 movie awards and won 53, mostly for Portman’s acting work but some for music or costumes. There were one Golden Globe (Portman) and three Oscar (Portman, costumes, music) nominations but zero wins. Portman gives a sharp and nuanced performance, worthy of all her awards, although I would have given Oscar to Isabelle Huppert in „Elle“, for even more exciting role. But the real winner was Emma Stone in „La La Land“ of course. You know, just saying.""Jackie"" is the kind of project which makes you doubt yourself as a movie lover. You see all the quality work on screen and wonder why actually you're not liking it more. It must be you, right, not being able to cherish all the good movies, right? Well, no. All the competent acting or dark and ominous atmosphere inspired by Malick, Aronofsky or Shyamalan can't compensate for a movie having no soul.So, where's the soul? Who knows. You can't always stay on the path with the heart just because you would like to. It goes to screenwriters and moviemakers too.",5.0,1,0

"Very average. It was exactly the same as the original story - a Death Star (but bigger and called something slightly different). The Good Guys have to get through the protective force-field, which is exactly the same story-line; a small squad of fighters have to destroy the force-field generator (which they manage to do right at the last second); the whole thing blows up, the Good Guys win, Bad Guys all dead, except one which allows a sequel.Also, they had to bring in EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER from the first movie. This is great for the actors, but felt completely artificial and unnecessary. C3P0 always was an irrelevance, and was still so in this film. Boooorrrrring bands in the bar, AGAIN.

"Medical engineer Ryan Stone works feverishly to repair her shuttle hundreds of miles from the Earth’s atmosphere after a catastrophic collision with orbiting debris damages her likelihood of reentry and survival in Gravity. Watching this movie you want to use terms like cool and awesome because, technically speaking, this movie is magnificent and awe-inspiring to watch. The purely computer generated images of the vast abyss of space, a cusp of Earth’s surface and a gleaming sun astronomically farther away in the background is spectacularly beautiful. With limited knowledge of space and aeronautics, this is about as real as I can imagine, though I know experts disagree – I’m looking at you Neil deGrasse Tyson. Beyond the aesthetically pleasing set design, I find little else in this picture remarkable. While beautiful, its artistry in scenery makes the film detached and voyeuristic. Gravity starts almost immediately with the collision and has very minimal character development initially. These factors led me to be unable to suspend disbelief and truly immerse myself in the story nor become invested in the main character’s survival. Further, the plot is tired and worn out. Several movies of a similar plot precede Gravity - which is basically a disaster survival story in space (most notably 2001: A Space Odyssey and Apollo 13, among others). I can’t help but imagine the executives at Warner Bros. and how this film came to be: We need a hit film, a huge money maker, but something new, fresh! CGI, its all about that CGI, that’s what sells movies…we’ve just got to take it to the next level! Yeah, but we’ve done just about everything on earth… That’s the problem! On Earth…space! Brilliant, and we will make it in Imax, get even more money for the tickets. Yeah, but we have to get actors that get a huge draw in the box office. Who is hot right now? Robert Downey Jr.? Angelina Jolie? Nah, Jolie has something scheduled already. Downey probably won’t want to do it, he’s too improvisational, won’t be his style. We could get Clooney? Everybody loves George. But what about the girl? Who won best actress last year? Jennifer Lawrence? Too young. Meryl Streep? Too old. Natalie Portman? Not likeable enough. How ’bout Sandra Bullock? Sandy will probably do it. But who is going to take the risk of making this movie? It could tank. Well, he will have to be a relative unknown, but made a hit before, international, so hungry to break into mainstream Hollywood. Alfonso Cuarón? I think he wanted to be an astronaut when he grew up. Isn’t he shopping a script set in space? And the rest is history… In all seriousness, the movie never connected with me, while visually brilliant, it is lacking in all other regards. If you are into special effects and the sheer technical breadth of the undertaking of that crew, whom I commend, then I suggest this movie.

"This film is, at least, controversial and difficult to judge. The plot is based on a crime and the difficult collaboration between an FBI agent and a very unorthodox Irish police officer, played by Brendan Gleeson. The work of this actor is excellent and gives strength to the film. No one can doubt it. He can fit his character in that sensitive gap between the comic and the grotesque, giving him a lightness worthy of a comedy full of black humor. He is a cop who does everything a cop should not do, and yet we feel empathy for him. Don Cheadle plays the conventional American cop but has funny dialogues, such as his Irish colleague, who seems to despise his methods and way of working, as well as not being able to say a sentence without causing embarrassment to his own force. In fact, dialogues are something to emphasize here. The use of slang is plentiful, so it's best to prevent younger ones from watching, but it was also the first time I ever heard Gaelic in a movie.",5.0,1,0

"One realizes about halfway through 'The Florida Project' that the entirety film is going to continue along a rather offbeat and non-traditional track.  The film is more atmospheric than plot driven, similar in that regard to last year's breakout hit 'Moonlight.'  Both the production team and acting talent on 'The Florida Project' did a phenomenal job at world-building, creating a realistic setting filled with distinct characters that oftentimes felt like watching a documentary.  However, it's the overall structure of the movie that makes it a flat-out chore to sit through.  Stories need a beginning, middle, and end.  'The Florida Project' is all middle.  Worse, it hardly has a main character.  Or at the very least it lacks any kind of protagonist/antagonist relationship in the traditional sense.  And by the time the asynchronous ending appeared on the screen, I was screaming in my head for the end credits to finally roll, as the two hour run-time felt more like three and I just wanted to go home.",6.0,0,1

Were there protesters among the people, who might have felt that the billions of dollars spent to save one life could have been used to benefit thousands of lives?

"This could arguably be Pixars greatest work, the first five minutes is without a doubt the greatest opening in cinema, getting all emotional scenes from evry film in history and putting them into one beautifully told and stunning scenes.

Performances are top notch and laughs are real laugh out loud ones, its every thing you could hope for in a film in one.

The film does not try to be this forced emotion present in most films, but is just there and is some of the most emotional scenes in film history.

"12 Years a Slave is a powerful, emotive, haunting and, ultimately revealing tale about a free black man, who is tricked and then kidnapped, being forced into bondage, and sold into slavery.As the title suggests, this lasts for 12 years, before he's able to get a conscientious white man to pass on a message, which brings one of his former friends and associates to come and rescue himSo far, so good.The film pulls no punches in its portrayal of life for a slave on a plantation. Long hours, repetitive work, threat of beatings (and death), not much food, risk of disease etc. As well as highlighting the inherent hypocrisy of the racist, white land/business owners, who seemingly justify their attitudes through judicious twisting of the tenets of the Bible.It's a film you can't ignore, and has created debate around the world. Well written, well directed and brilliantly acted. However, it just falls a little short of being a modern masterpiece and morality tale.The main reason is that you can always sense it's based on a work of non-fiction, and is trying to be true to the author's observations and points of view.As such, the director has to rein in the narrative, and therefore struggles to fill the run-time of the movie. There's not enough actual plot to sustain 132 minutes, and so many scenes just drag on with unnecessarily long tracking shots, or dialogue that adds nothing to either the plot or the characters.Another issue I personally had was that the slaves in the film all spoke with good diction and pronunciation. It bugs me when historical films (especially one such as this which was praised for its' accuracy) don't apply proper accents/vocal inflections, during a time when we actually know how people spoke.The other issue is that the ending is a good ol', US of A, 'feel good' ending. They could have, and should have, concluded the film with a lingering, panning shot of  the dozens of other slaves toiling away and who didn't manage to get 'rescued', those who were slaughtered by the thousand after the South surrendered at the end of the Civil War.....",7.0,0,1

"Like any great band or artist, Talking Heads were about more than just a few dozen great songs and albums. Whether by design or by accident, they become an idea. For Elvis, it was smashing cultural boundaries and having a good time, for Radiohead, a solemn prayer for our collective angst. And for Talking Heads, it was a simple but profound statement acceptance of what it is to be human. Talking Heads have a pretty extensive catalogue, from the immaculately produced sonic wizardry of Fear Of Music  and Remain In Light, to the funky fresh Talking Heads: 77 and Speaking In Tongues, but, for all intents and purposes, Stop Making Sense is the ultimate Heads experience.What's on display here is music reached an international audience because it expressed music as a universal language. You see some funky African performers that clearly think this American white dude just wrote the most kickass stuff on planet Earth, and you have these clever little tricks, like a ray of light serendipitously shining on drummer Chris Frantz as he pounds away at the heavenly ""Thank You For Sending Me An Angel"", and you have David Byrne crying out ""Thanks!"" to the crowd between songs in much the same tone as you do in your car when someone waves you in at an intersection. They didn't need fancy words to write songs about being afraid of Heaven, or about being ""just an animal looking for a home."" They took some advanced, college-education musical stuff and made it look simple. They made it look easy. And when you watch David Byrne in his oversized suit fumble around onstage to a hip-hop rendition of one of his songs, you start to realize: It was never that hard being human. Everyone's afraid. No one knows what they're supposed to do with their hands, nor have they been handed a written code on how to maneuver a crowded set of urinals. You didn't sound all that dumb when you went on that diatribe about how there are no real bad guys in the world at your friend's wedding. In fact, most present would say you had a point. No, you didn't happen to sleep in the one day they explained the meaning of life and what happens when we die, and most everything you were told as a kid was some ape's best guess. And that's okay.

"About a week ago, Wife was lamenting the fact that we’ve abruptly hit the bottom of the summer movie well, with no interest in seeing Child’s Play and too much self-respect to see Men In Black: International, and no theaters that are featuring her anticipated The Farewell, and then she found this playing up in Palo Alto.... Wild Rose is Buckley’s sophomore film–matching nicely with compatriot Florence Pugh this year–and it has lots going for it.This is the way that Wife set up the film for me: I think it’s about a young woman who’s a single mother (but not so single because she seems to be getting some help from her mother) from Scotland who wants to abandon her family in order to pursue a career in country singing in America. Sold. At that time I wasn’t even aware that Buckley was the star, but by that time the absurdity of that premise and the prospect of seeing a film about America from the outside in was all I needed.There seems to be a bit of serendipity about the timing of this film. I think these types of outsider films about America have a lot of appeal because they have a way of describing the positive aspects of American culture at a fraught time in our politics without appearing like a Pollyanna.Wild Rose goes about representing under-represented parts of America by creating a compelling “trans-national” character, one that in the hands of a less sensitive and thoughtful director and actor might have come off as quirky and magical, but here does nothing of the sort. The film makes no effort to make Rose-Lynn sympathetic for the first two thirds of the film, Wife and I agreed, and then in that last act, it dares you not to like her. It’s kind of ambitious how far out of its way the film is willing to go for you to resent her delinquency, her effortless lying.Meanwhile, the music of this film is an exquisite mix of covers by Buckley and thoughtfully chosen songs from the country canon. The one line from an improvised song she sings early on in the film rang in my ears for days afterwards: “Every good thing that ever happens, happens from the inside out.” (Feels a little bit like a line you’d hear in Terry Pratchett’s I Shall Wear Midnight series.) The final song Glasgow is a showstopper. The Oz metaphor captures the strain between her professional aspirations, personal desires, and familial obligations in a really powerful way.Afterwards, Wife said that Buckley had actually got her start in acting by being on a television singing competition-type show, the same sort she blows off as an option in the film in a bit of meta-theater. It shows: I’m not a country music aficionado, so it was hard for me to know at the time of watching whether she was covering most of the film’s soundtrack herself or if we were listening to other women in the country music scene, but the upcoming movie soundtrack is filled with Buckley’s covers, which fills me with joy.The redemptive makeover that the audience is expecting is never really served. Instead, Rose-Lynn remains an unformed, though more self-aware and mature character. Wild Rose’s depiction of Rose-Lynn does an excellent job of representing a Millennial sense of imposter syndrome through the relentless reminders that Rose-Lynn is ordinary: “Do you play?” a beloved BBC radio cameo by Bob Harris asks, “Do you write?” She answers no and the audience is informed of how hopeless and starry-eyed her dreams are. “You would not believe how many people do that exact thing,” the security guard tells her outside the Grand Opry in Nashville, poking holes in what feels at the time like a heartfelt moment a long time coming.The delightful weirdness Rose-Lynn’s transnational love affair is in and of itself a reason to see this film. If for no other reason than to learn that there are enclaves of country music in the far reaches of the British Isles, bars that faithfully reconstruct our Americana, and singers who drop their accents to take on ours. The **** of America is at first a joyous love letter to Nashville and the country music scene, and even when her actual journey is anything but, it still finds way to represent the charm and depth of feeling of Nashville through her lyrics and the energy of their simulacrum of Nashville back home.Wife was a little miffed that the solution to Rose-Lynn’s problem was through money even if the source was different than anticipated. I really liked the party plot line and it’s twist.If you are similarly in the desert of films this summer, one of the rare movie-goers who has been saving yourself for something other than MIB, then check Wild Rose out.",10.0,0,1

"I'm not sure if it was just overhyped or if it was because the movie was attempting to lay the groundwork for the trilogy, but I was underwhelmed after seeing this film. The acting was mediocre at best. While Daisy Ridley did a great job of being a good fighter in the film, the intimate or emotional scenes were cringe worthy to say the least. I thought that John Boyega, while funny, almost seemed out of place throughout the film. I don't think this was necessarily his fault as it may have been the writing, but his character just didn't act like a Star Wars character. He acted almost just like a normal person you'd run into anywhere. There were far too many cliché moments in this movie. It has a nearly identical plot with 'A New Hope' only this time the planet killing space object is bigger and badder. Kylo Ren was fantastic, until he took off his mask. After that it seemed whenever he spoke he was struggling not to cry. The movie does contain a good twist near the end. However, the final duel is a bit ridiculous to me, as Rey has no experience fighting nor using the force and yet is able to hold her own in a fight with a sith. To me it just seemed absurd. I was disappointed in the movie overall, and I hope the next movies are better. Should you see it? Of course you should, its Star Wars.

"Gravity (2013): Utterly Weightless Let's just get this out of the way up front- if you're to garner even one iota of enjoyment out of Gravity it must be viewed on the largest screen possible donning a pair of 3D glasses. Surround sound is also imperative but if you've managed a Big Screen 3D setup, odds are you've got the audio side of the equation covered. Experiencing Gravity in any other way is simply not an option. I was fortunate enough to see Gravity on a 55"" active 3D display in Dolby 5.1 (my home theater setup) and that would be considered the bare minimum requirement. It's certainly no Imax. Imagine watching the latest Pixar flick on a portable black and white monitor with the sound muted. Sound like fun? No? Then don't bother watching this in the comfort of your living room unless your home theater meets AT LEAST the previously stated requirements. This really can't be stressed enough. Onto the review... 2001, Alien, Moon. These films are considered classics of American cinema for very good reason, they all have superb story arcs bolstered by deep, rich character development. Alfonso Cuarón’s latest theatrical release, Gravity, has neither. Much like the empty environment the film takes place in, Gravity offers up breathtaking visuals but is utterly devoid of anything else. Instead of a proper film, we're ""treated"" to an artistic experiment in the use of state of the art visual and audio effects to induce an intimate form of awe and panic. Something a standard 2D stereo film can't possibly replicate. And, as such, it's a smashing success. In one especially intense scene early on during Act I, Cuarón utilizes his trademarked long form single camera shot sequence (13 minutes to be exact) to make us feel the empty helplessness that Dr. Ryan (played adequately by Sandra Bullock) is surely experiencing. It works to great effect, and don't be surprised if a bit of sweat drips from your brow in the process. So far, so good and we feel invested in our own survival. Not Dr. Ryan's survival mind you, she doesn't exist so much as a character but more of a human prop to advance the films running time. No, the clever use of 3D photography has us invested far more in our own well being then either that of Dr. Ryan or Matt Kowalsky (again, adequately played by George Clooney). I, for one, have felt neither dread nor danger in the cinema or my own couch outside of this expertly crafted opening sequence. And then...nothing. This pony has flawlessly performed it's single trick. And it is quite the trick, but not something that can sustain any amount of interest past the 30 minute mark. I take pride in writing spoiler free reviews, so suffice it to say Gravity takes place in space (that much should already be abundantly clear), while ""space stuff"" sporadically explodes silently, life support mechanisms fail, and our two protagonists fight to make their way back to Cape Canaveral, or any place on Earth really, in one piece. While a superficial attempt at character development is made by the filmmakers to inject Dr. Ryan and Kowalsky with heart and soul, it doesn't work. The failure to make us care about the films only two human assets is Gravity's greatest weakness. Will Ryan and Kowalsky triumph over the terrors of being stranded in space when their only ride back home has been devastated, or will they float endlessly into the dark abyss until they die slowly of asphyxiation? We have no emotional investment tied to either character, so who cares if they live or die? Maybe Kowalsky is a pedophile who deserves it. I don't know anything about him other than he was at Mardi Gras in 1987 and likes to talk about it. Ultimately, Gravity is a visual spectacle that elevates the use of 3D in moviemaking to new heights, much like James Cameron did with Avatar. The difference being Cameron told a story, one that we actually cared about. The same can't be said for Gravity. As much as the movie going audience and critics alike bemoan the use of 3D in modern filmmaking, Gravity shows us that, when done properly, the addition of a third dimension draws us in much closer to the story being told. But if that story isn't engaging and the characters aren't captivating, no amount of floating wrenches and exploding spaceships will transform a lackluster movie into a good one. I love 3D and hope Gravity's success spurs a second renaissance for the fading technology. If nothing else, this film proves without question that 3D can draw viewers into a movie in a way that standard two dimensions never could. What 3D will never be able to do, however, is create an interesting story where one simply doesn't exist, as is the case with Gravity. If you have the means to experience this film the way it was intended, you should absolutely do so. It very well may change your opinion on the importance of 3D in movie making. Just don't go in expecting a good movie, because Gravity isn't one.",5.0,1,0

A few times I braced myself for a dreadingly dark sequence. By the end I took all the things from the movie that the Director was wanting to place in my mind as...something more. The reason for the 'average' score, is that it was pretty long with what felt like less of a real ""eureka"" moment than I'd of hoped. Daniel-Day Lewis is everything advertised and more.

"Catching Fire is set a year after Katniss and Peeta survived the 74th Hunger Games; their actions in the Games sparked the fires of a rebellion throughout the districts. President Snow tries to quell the rebellion by using Katniss and Peeta and re-entering them in the 75th Hunger Games Anniversary alongside other veterans of the Hunger Games. Catching Fire has the premises of an amazing, dramatic and action-packed movie yet seems to fall flat when it’s meant to be at its best. Don’t be mistaken, Catching Fire is not a bad movie and is a definite improvement over the Hunger Games. The larger budget and the directing skills of Francis Lawrence greatly improve the overall quality of acting and special effects seen in the movie. Yet dramatic moments such as the apparent deaths of a leading character is made stupid looking by Katniss’ weird crying face and the fact that the audience is not foolish enough to actually believe they would have killed them off.  Jennifer Lawrence’s acting, along with some of her co-stars; falls flat at key moments of the movie even during the supposed Katniss actually falls for Peeta scene is stale. Then again I compare actors to Liam Neeson and the whole cast of Lord of the Rings, so maybe I’m setting too high a bar. I’ve talked about some of the negatives now onto the positives; Sam Claflin as Finnick Odair is easily my favourite protagonist who competes in the Hunger Games. While he is not the best actor in the movie, that award goes to Woody Harrelson, he is the only one in the Games who you actually see fight other contestants and the mutated monkeys. President Snow the movies main antagonist is an easy competitor to Haymitch’s best actor spot; he may not have many lines in the movie but the ones he does he delivers perfectly and even just the close ups of his face show more emotion then Jennifer Lawrence’s entire performance. The special effects for the movie are a definite and obvious improvement from its prequel, which looked so fake it made Giant Shark vs. Mega Octopus look real. Unfortunately I can’t go on with the good points of the movie because there are none left. So I will return to the negatives; plot twists. There is one major plot twist that is probably the most important thing in the entire movie, which I saw coming from a mile away, you can tell who good guys are and who the bad guys are in the movie because of the way they dress. If they look like they fell through Louie Spence’s wardrobe they are most likely the bad guys, the exception being President Snow. The ending of the movie is as weird as the way the people dress in the Capitol; it just seems to stop without any feeling of an actual conclusion. The Grey did the same thing but managed to pull it off because the Grey is a great movie, which just shows that that kind of ending does work and can make a movie excellent.",2.0,1,0

"Ah, a look back over 30 years of American history through the eyes of a somewhat retarded individual is so overtly romanticised and with so much 'apple pie' about it, that I've never understood why it's regarded as some kind of masterpiece. The entire movie is just one unbelievable set-piece followed by another, as we watch young Forrest grow into adulthood, attend college, fight in Vietnam, become a world class ping-pong player, create THE dominant shrimp catching business in the US, become an international news story (in of himself) as he spends 3 years running back and forth across America, before he finally gets to marry the love of his life.... Before she dies of AIDS and dumps her kid (Forrest's son, who she kept away from him right up until she knew she was dying) in his lap and just expects him to carry on his life. Therein lies the film's biggest problems.... For all that is good, in how it uses Forrest's life experiences to form a narrative that includes a large number of important cultural moments in American history through the early 1950's to the early 1980's, there is a something fundamentally bad.In order for the film to work you have to believe that Forrest can merrily walk through life, getting involved in all the major incidents around him, and not query how on Earth it would ever happen.I just couldn't do that, so watched the film more as a parody, than a drama. The other fundamental problem with the film and, as an audience, one we just have to accept.... Is that Forrest is in love with a woman who is incredibly self-centred and borderline sociopathic. All the way through the film she just treats Forrest like crap, and although she eventually gets her own comeuppance (dying of AIDS in her late 30's) it doesn't make up for everything she did to Forrest.... Plus, as mentioned, her dying act is to foist a small child on him, a child that will remind him every day about the woman he lost (well, never really had.... But whom he loved!!) The only good part of the film is the soundtrack... It is crammed with excellent songs from the 50's through to the early 80's, the 'Vietnam' era part having (obviously) the best. I suspect my aversion to the movie could well be because I'm English, so I'm a spectator watching the game, rather than someone living in America who might latch onto the sentimentality a little more easily!

" The government isn't after the fish. This almost Henry Darger-like mermaid(because all the fish are curiously female) poses no threat to national security. Nobody wants to dissect this Vivian siren. That's the cliche of most American movies whenever there's a non-human creature on the loose. For instance, Ron Howard's ""Splash"", in which authorities track down the otherworldly entity with the intent to kill. ""Ponyo"" gets around this banality by making the mermaid's pursuer a benevolent one. As a result, the film is lacking in suspense, which may put off a western audience, largely used to shopworn tropes such as FBI agents in black coats and shades, and a chase of some sort. Starting with the mother, the incongruous sight of a fish equipped with a human girl's face, never alarms like it would, or should, in most filmic cases. If the fish-face did, Ponyo's notoriety would eventually get the law's attention with predictable results. Sophisticated as all Pixar films are, the collected works of this filmmaker truly diverges from animation's preordained roots as strictly a children's genre. ""Ponyo"" distinguishes itself through its naturalistic domestic scenes, which are virtually indistinguishable from the human interaction you'd find in a live-action film. A good deal of time is spent on establishing the relationships within a family unit, which may some find boring, as the mother tends to her son and his new playmate with great deliberation. The bar is raised, quietly, as these seemingly uneventful moments that establish character are more exciting than the gorgeous depictions of the girl's underwater world, and the subsequent hurricane above, because such lifelike simulacrum helps make the case for animation as being the equal of your so-called ""serious"" films. (NOTE: Dubbing is a necessary evil to attract larger audiences, but some of the dialogue, notably towards the end, is truly hideous.)",9.0,0,1
" You owe it to yourself to see this film after enduring all the other horrible, soulless movies that came out this summer. Forget GI Joe, leave Transformers 2 behind; please, please please do yourself the favour of seeing District 9. Great for all ages, engaging and stimulating... if you've got kids they'll walk out of the theater wanting to be movie-makers when they grow up. God help me; I wish more movies were like this one!",10.0,0,1
"Aside from a fine supporting performance by Julianne Moore, this alleged screwball romantic comedy is slow-paced, unfunny and not especially amorous. What more is there to say? It's basically a lightweight, eminently forgettable picture, one that I'm amazed ever reached production.",5.0,1,0
"The scene where Wakandan soldiers fight each other was like a reference to the American Civil War. Maybe it wasn't, I'm not sure but all those blue vs red guards looked like an African version of it.I really liked historical references and the details about African culture. The film is a visual feast at its best. I simply can't wait to watch and learn about Wakanda.Last super hero films bored me a lot but thanks to Black Panther, Marvel excites me again.",8.0,0,1
"Would have been better if the story actually went somewhere, the first half and probably more seemed unimportant and only the last 30 mins or so were actually interesting and showed something worth seeing",6.0,0,1
"A plodding narrative that glamourises a sad and seedy business. It needed better writing, direction and acting.",5.0,1,0
"Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva play a Parisian couple in their 80s. When she has an attack, he nurses her thru the final agonizing days. Michael Haneke is a skilled director, who's at his most stark and dispassionate, which translates into interminable pacing, uncompromising camera and oblique narrative. If you like watching the deterioration of a woman in a detached, heavy and bleak atmosphere, you may appreciate this well-acted but agonizing (in so many ways) examination. Call me shallow, but I wasn't moved.",5.0,1,0
" Truly a new experience in CG has been enveiled and Cameron has set the bar VERY high for anyone else that wants to achieve. 4 years he worked on this and it came together flawless. I was mesmorized through the entire movie. As long as it was, I felt it was too short. Can't wait to see it in 3D if given the chance and I will definately buy the directors cut. This movie has earned my second favorite movie of all time!",10.0,0,1
"Yes, I liked the movie. Great performances and everything. But, a lot of people calls it ""Woody Allen's best work"", at least recently. That's not right. Mainly because it's not really his. Why? ""A Streetcar Named Desire"". The plot so similar, and you can notice it since the very beginning.",4.0,1,0
"Not really as well made as everyone thought. The story is bland and I have lived through the same life, why put on the screen just try to show off your unique life?",0.0,1,0
 Two words: Richard Donner. I used to think this was the best Superman movie ever and one of the best movies period.....that is until I learned of the entire back story to Richard Donner's 'dismissal' from the project. I can't wait to se 'The Richard Donner Cut' of Superman II and say that his version should be held as the official version.,0.0,1,0
 Anybody who says Pan's Labyrinth is boring is a totally unsophisticated person with the mind of a 10 year old. My full review is on Rotten Tomatoes. My SN on there is Ryguy4738 M.,10.0,0,1
" Disappointing. After peeping the 97 Metascore on this site, I was expecting...more. More gorgeous visuals. More nightmarish monsters. More lullabies into the dreamy world which del Toro was creating. Just...more. Ultimately, I felt short changed. The movie was good...but very...far short on the promise.",8.0,0,1
 Okay this is not 'Goodfellas'. Cartoony is the best adjective I can use to describe the film. Actually I was expecting Roger Rabbit to appear at the end and shoot Walhberg.,4.0,1,0
