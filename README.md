Metacritic Movie Reviews Scraping
This Code helps you to get the user reviews from https://www.metacritic.com/.

First level I wrote the code that extracted "Best Movies Of All Time" from the Movies section.
the columns which have been extracted are the following:
Movie Number,Title,Rating Status,Release Date,Metascore,UserScore,movielink.

Second Level I  extracedt the user reviews with their rank for the first 2500 film presentend in the dataset of all Movies.it's arround 80,000 reviews and I have splited them into five CSVs with the same structure.

You are able to use these files to build any model as long as using the code to extract more data if needed.
